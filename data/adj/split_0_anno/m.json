They did this in two different ways: switching between CO2 and air every minute, or continuously breathing in CO2. The volunteers rated their pain levels every minute.\n\nUnlike the animal experiments, the CO2 didn't help the human volunteers much. It only lowered their pain ratings a little bit - only 5.3%. Even that small effect was lost when the volunteers were asked to breathe in CO2 continuously. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that while it's interesting to see that CO2 has a small effect on this type of pain in humans, it's not enough to be really helpful for treating pain.","edits":[{"category":"hol_eval","id":0,"annotation":{"hol_question_1":{"val":"hol_child_3"}}},{"category":"final_q","id":1},{"category":"pico_pop","id":2,"annotation":{"pico_pop_anno":{"val":"q4_1"},"pico_pop_rat":"The Population is described as a group of healthy volunteers that didn't have head or face pain before."}},{"category":"pico_inter","id":3,"annotation":{"pico_pop_inter":{"val":"q4_1"},"pico_inter_rat":"The Intervention is described as inhaling CO2, this is accurate and matching the description from the abstract."}},{"category":"pico_comp","id":4,"annotation":{"pico_pop_comp":{"val":"q4_4"},"pico_comp_rat":"The placebo mentioned in the abstract is not mentioned in the summary"}},{"category":"pico_out","id":5,"annotation":{"pico_pop_out":{"val":"q4_1"},"pico_out_rat":"The summary describes the outcome by the experienced pain level from the volunteers.

Clinical benefit from CO2 inhalation in patients with craniofacial pain caused by a putative activation of TRPV1 receptor positive trigeminal neurons has also been reported. These effects are probably mediated via an activation of TRPV1 receptor - positive neurons in the nasal mucosa with subsequent central inhibitory effects (such as conditioned pain modulation). In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of intranasal CO2 on a human model of craniofacial pain elicited by nasal application of capsaicin.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:\nIn a first experiment, 48 healthy volunteers without previous craniofacial pain received intranasal capsaicin to provoke trigeminal pain elicited by activation of TRVP1 positive nociceptive neurons. Then, CO2 or air was insufflated alternatingly into the nasal cavity at a flow rate of 1 l/min for 60 sec each. In the subsequent experiment, all participants were randomized into 2 groups of 24 each and received either continuous nasal insufflation of CO2 or placebo for 18:40 min after nociceptive stimulation with intranasal capsaicin. In both experiments, pain was rated on a numerical rating scale every 60 sec.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:\nContrary to previous animal studies, the effects of CO2 on experimental trigeminal pain were only marginal. In the first experiment, CO2 reduced pain ratings only minimally by 5.3% compared to air if given alternatingly with significant results for the main factor GROUP (F1,47 = 4.438; p = 0.041) and the interaction term TIME*GROUP (F2.6,121.2 = 3.3; p = 0.029) in the repeated-measures ANOVA. However, these effects were abrogated after continuous insufflation of CO2 or placebo with no significant changes for the main factors or the interaction term.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:\nAlthough mild modulatory effects of low-flow intranasal CO2 could be seen in this human model of TRPV-1 mediated activation of nociceptive trigeminal neurons, utility is limited as observed changes in pain ratings are clinically non-significant.","target":"\nThe researchers looked at how a gas called carbon dioxide (CO2) affects pain in people.

They asked the people to rate their pain on a special scale every 60 seconds for a few minutes. They found out that the CO2 didn't really help much with the pain, and the changes they saw were not big enough to be important.
