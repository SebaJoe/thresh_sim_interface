        "target": "Metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors for heart disease, including high blood pressure and insulin resistance. Losartan, an antihypertensive agent, was compared to telmisartan, which has evidence of partial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activity-gamma (PPAR\u03b3) activity. The study found that telmisartan, but not losartan, reduced free plasma glucose, free plasma insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and HbA1c. It also reduced 24-hour mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures compared to losartan. These results suggest that telmisartan may be more effective than losartan in treating metabolic syndrome.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt;",

Both the condition and its individual issues can lead to heart disease. There's a medicine named Telmisartan that doctors give people with high blood pressure. People think it could also help with how the body uses sugar and might improve other aspects of metabolic syndrome.\n\nThey did a trial where they picked some patients who had metabolic syndrome and divided them into two groups. For three months, one group took Telmisartan every day, while the other group took another drug named Losartan.\n\nBy the end of the trial, the group that took Telmisartan showed better results. They had lower sugar levels, the body used sugar more efficiently, and lower hemoglobin A1c, a measure of blood sugar over time. They also had lower blood pressure at all times compared to those who took Losartan. It seems that Telmisartan helped the body use sugar more efficiently partly because it works partially as a PPAR\u03b3 controller (which is like a switch inside your cells that helps manage sugar and fat). \n\nIn summary, the medicine Telmisartan was better at managing blood pressure and helped improve how the body uses sugar, unlike Losartan. This means it could be useful for people suffering from metabolic syndrome.",

The main problem for these patients is that they look pale because their blood does not have enough healthy red cells. The researchers did an experiment with two groups of children between ages 1 to 15. One group was given a drug called Dhatri Avaleha, which is known to help with symptoms similar to those caused by Thalassemia. The other group did not receive the drug. After checking these children for 60 days, the scientists found that the children who took the drug needed blood transfusions less often than the others. This suggests that Dhatri Avaleha might be useful to help manage Thalassemia along with other medical treatments.",

Clinical benefit from CO2 inhalation in patients with craniofacial pain caused by a putative activation of TRPV1 receptor positive trigeminal neurons has also been reported. These effects are probably mediated via an activation of TRPV1 receptor - positive neurons in the nasal mucosa with subsequent central inhibitory effects (such as conditioned pain modulation). In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of intranasal CO2 on a human model of craniofacial pain elicited by nasal application of capsaicin.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:\nIn a first experiment, 48 healthy volunteers without previous craniofacial pain received intranasal capsaicin to provoke trigeminal pain elicited by activation of TRVP1 positive nociceptive neurons. Then, CO2 or air was insufflated alternatingly into the nasal cavity at a flow rate of 1 l/min for 60 sec each. In the subsequent experiment, all participants were randomized into 2 groups of 24 each and received either continuous nasal insufflation of CO2 or placebo for 18:40 min after nociceptive stimulation with intranasal capsaicin. In both experiments, pain was rated on a numerical rating scale every 60 sec.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:\nContrary to previous animal studies, the effects of CO2 on experimental trigeminal pain were only marginal. In the first experiment, CO2 reduced pain ratings only minimally by 5.3% compared to air if given alternatingly with significant results for the main factor GROUP (F1,47\u2009=\u20094.438; p\u2009=\u20090.041) and the interaction term TIME*GROUP (F2.6,121.2\u2009=\u20093.3; p\u2009=\u20090.029) in the repeated-measures ANOVA. However, these effects were abrogated after continuous insufflation of CO2 or placebo with no significant changes for the main factors or the interaction term.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:\nAlthough mild modulatory effects of low-flow intranasal CO2 could be seen in this human model of TRPV-1 mediated activation of nociceptive trigeminal neurons, utility is limited as observed changes in pain ratings are clinically non-significant.",

Clinical benefit from CO2 inhalation in patients with craniofacial pain caused by a putative activation of TRPV1 receptor positive trigeminal neurons has also been reported. These effects are probably mediated via an activation of TRPV1 receptor - positive neurons in the nasal mucosa with subsequent central inhibitory effects (such as conditioned pain modulation). In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of intranasal CO2 on a human model of craniofacial pain elicited by nasal application of capsaicin.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:\nIn a first experiment, 48 healthy volunteers without previous craniofacial pain received intranasal capsaicin to provoke trigeminal pain elicited by activation of TRVP1 positive nociceptive neurons. Then, CO2 or air was insufflated alternatingly into the nasal cavity at a flow rate of 1 l/min for 60 sec each. In the subsequent experiment, all participants were randomized into 2 groups of 24 each and received either continuous nasal insufflation of CO2 or placebo for 18:40 min after nociceptive stimulation with intranasal capsaicin. In both experiments, pain was rated on a numerical rating scale every 60 sec.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:\nContrary to previous animal studies, the effects of CO2 on experimental trigeminal pain were only marginal. In the first experiment, CO2 reduced pain ratings only minimally by 5.3% compared to air if given alternatingly with significant results for the main factor GROUP (F1,47\u2009=\u20094.438; p\u2009=\u20090.041) and the interaction term TIME*GROUP (F2.6,121.2\u2009=\u20093.3; p\u2009=\u20090.029) in the repeated-measures ANOVA. However, these effects were abrogated after continuous insufflation of CO2 or placebo with no significant changes for the main factors or the interaction term.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:\nAlthough mild modulatory effects of low-flow intranasal CO2 could be seen in this human model of TRPV-1 mediated activation of nociceptive trigeminal neurons, utility is limited as observed changes in pain ratings are clinically non-significant.",
        "target": "This study talks about a type of pain that happens in the face and head. Scientists have found in some animal experiments that letting them breathe in CO2 - the gas we breathe out - can help with this pain. They thought it might work by interacting with certain nerves in our nose. So, they wanted to see if the same thing could help humans too. \n\nThey first tested it on healthy volunteers who didn't have any head or face pain before. They used capsaicin - the stuff that makes chili peppers hot - to cause the pain, then had them breathe in either CO2 or regular air. They did this in two different ways: switching between CO2 and air every minute, or continuously breathing in CO2. The volunteers rated their pain levels every minute.\n\nUnlike the animal experiments, the CO2 didn't help the human volunteers much. It only lowered their pain ratings a little bit - only 5.3%. Even that small effect was lost when the volunteers were asked to breathe in CO2 continuously. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that while it's interesting to see that CO2 has a small effect on this type of pain in humans, it's not enough to be really helpful for treating pain.",

The studied patients had neuromuscular diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy, and cerebral palsy. The patients were randomly divided into two groups (case and control); The case group underwent daily chest physiotherapy through vibrator and chest percussion and the control group was under supervision. In the latter group, the underlying disease was treated and the lung collapse was managed, if occurred.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nThe frequency of atelectasis was lower in the case group who received prophylactic chest physiotherapy compared to the control group (16.6% vs. 40%).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.\nChest physiotherapy as well as appropriate and regular change of position can considerably reduce the rate of pulmonary collapse in pediatric patients.",
        "target": "This passage is about a study that was done to see if a special type of therapy for your chest, called chest physiotherapy, could prevent a condition known as lung collapse in kids, after they have a tube removed from their throat. The study included kids who had certain types of muscle or nerve diseases. They had two groups, one group that got chest physiotherapy and another group that was just watched and treated for their disease but they didn't get the chest physiotherapy.\n\nAfter doing the study, they found out that the kids who had the chest physiotherapy had less lung collapses compared to the group that didn't have the therapy (16.6% vs 40%). The researchers concluded that chest physiotherapy can help reduce the chances of lung collapse in patients, especially when it's combined with changing the child's position regularly.",

        "target": "Scientists wanted to know if a drug called aceclofenac, made in two different ways, could help people with knee pain from arthritis, and if it was safe. They tested it on 125 people, with some of them getting one version and some the other. They measured things like how much it hurt, how well the knee moved, and did other medical tests to check if the drug was safe. After 4 weeks, they found that both forms of the drug helped with pain and movement, and neither of them caused any harmful effects. The new form of the drug only needs to be taken once a day, which could be easier for people.",

Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages, it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients.\n\nABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS.\nThe effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) (2 mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients (men [50.7%], women [49.3%], average age 75.3 years [range, 52\u201385 years]) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD, with and without insomnia comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine). In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks placebo. The AD Assessment Scale\u2013Cognition (ADAS-Cog), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Mini\u2013Mental State Examination (MMSE), sleep, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a daily sleep diary, and safety parameters were measured.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nPatients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044). Mean ADAS-Cog did not differ between the groups. Sleep efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM (P=0.017). In the comorbid insomnia (PSQI \u22656) subgroup, PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo, in mean IADL (P=0.032), MMSE score (+1.5 versus \u22123 points) (P=0.0177), and sleep efficiency (P=0.04). Median ADAS-Cog values (\u22123.5 versus +3 points) (P=0.045) were significantly better with PRM. Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration. PRM was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.\nAdd-on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo, particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity. The results suggest a possible causal link between poor sleep and cognitive decline.",

Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages, it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients.\n\nABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS.\nThe effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) (2 mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients (men [50.7%], women [49.3%], average age 75.3 years [range, 52\u201385 years]) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD, with and without insomnia comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine). In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks placebo. The AD Assessment Scale\u2013Cognition (ADAS-Cog), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Mini\u2013Mental State Examination (MMSE), sleep, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a daily sleep diary, and safety parameters were measured.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nPatients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044). Mean ADAS-Cog did not differ between the groups. Sleep efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM (P=0.017). In the comorbid insomnia (PSQI \u22656) subgroup, PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo, in mean IADL (P=0.032), MMSE score (+1.5 versus \u22123 points) (P=0.0177), and sleep efficiency (P=0.04). Median ADAS-Cog values (\u22123.5 versus +3 points) (P=0.045) were significantly better with PRM. Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration. PRM was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.\nAdd-on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo, particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity. The results suggest a possible causal link between poor sleep and cognitive decline.",
        "target": "Scientists were curious about a hormone called melatonin that we don't have as much of when we don't sleep well and when we get older. They gave extra melatonin to some older people who have Alzheimer's disease, which can make you forget things. Some of those people also had trouble sleeping. The scientists did a test and found out that the people who took the extra melatonin remembered things better and slept better than the people who didn't take it, especially those who had trouble sleeping. This might mean that not sleeping well could also cause memory problems. The extra melatonin didn't make people feel sick and was safe to take. So, it looks like it could be helpful for people with Alzheimer's disease, especially if they also have problems with sleeping.",

The width of keratinized tissue was also significantly (P &lt; 0.001) increased in both groups, but the increase was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.001) in group B (2.30 \u00b1 1.06 mm) than in group A (1.21 \u00b1 0.67 mm).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.\nThe envelope type of CAF along with Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM) was more effective than envelope type of CAF alone, in producing root coverage in multiple gingival recession defects, associated with gain in CAL as also in the width of KT.",
        "target": "\nThe study compared how well two different treatments work for people with multiple gum recessions. One treatment used a special type of gum tissue to cover the exposed roots, and the other used a special membrane to help the gum tissue grow back. The study found that using both treatments together worked better than using just one of them. The gum tissue grew back more and the gum recession got smaller.\n\n\n\n\n",

This disease can cause a lot of pain and problems that can make it hard for people to do their job or chores at home. \n\nIn the experiment, they divided people into three groups. The first group got a fake pill with no medicine, the second group got a small amount of CZP every 2 weeks, and the third group got a larger amount of CZP every 4 weeks. They asked these people questions about how many days they missed work or couldn't do their household chores, and how much they were able to join in family, social and leisure activities.\n\nThey found out that people who got CZP missed fewer days of work, were able to do more chores at home, and could join family activities more than those who took the fake pill. The people with CZP started to feel better and do more activities as early as the 4th week and continued to improve until the 24th week of the treatment. \n\nSo, the experiment showed that CZP medicine can help people with psoriatic arthritis do their jobs, chores, and activities better than before.",

The arthritis-specific Work Productivity Survey (WPS) assessed the impact of PsA on paid work and household productivity, and participation in social activities during the preceding month. WPS responses were compared between treatment arms using a non-parametric bootstrap-t method.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nAt baseline, 56.6%, 60.1% and 61.5% of placebo, CZP 200 mg Q2W and CZP 400 mg Q4W patients were employed. By week 24, employed CZP patients reported an average of 1.0\u20131.8 and 3.0\u20133.9 fewer days of absenteeism and presenteeism, respectively, per month compared with 1.0 and 0.3 fewer days for placebo patients (p&lt;0.05). Within the home, by week 24, CZP patients reported an average of 3.0\u20133.5 household work days gained per month versus 1.0 day for placebo (p&lt;0.05). CZP patients also reported fewer days with reduced household productivity or days lost for participation in family, social and leisure activities. Improvements with CZP were seen as early as week 4 and continued to week 24.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.\nCZP treatment significantly improved productivity at paid work and within the home, and resulted in greater participation in social activities for PsA patients.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER.\nNCT01087788.",
        "target": "\nThe researchers wanted to see how a medicine called certolizumab pegol helps people with a condition called psoriatic arthritis. They looked at how much work people with psoriatic arthritis could do and how many days they missed work or had trouble doing things at home. They found that people who took the medicine had better productivity at work and at home, and they were able to participate in more social activities than people who took a placebo (a fake medicine). The improvements started as early as 4 weeks after starting the medicine and continued for 24 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n",

Furthermore, healthy controls revealed increased rsFC of the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus in this network relative to the placebo treatment in patients. Our results indicate that acute heroin substitution induces a subjective rewarding effect via increased striatal connectivity in heroin-dependent patients, suggesting that positive reinforcement effects in the striatum still occur after protracted maintenance therapy.",
        "target": "\nThis means that when people take heroin, their brain gets a little happy feeling. It's like when you eat your favorite food and it tastes really good. The heroin makes the brain happy by connecting with other parts of the brain that help us feel good. And the more connected these parts are, the happier the brain gets. But sometimes, the brain can get too happy and that can be bad. So, scientists studied what happens in the brain when people take heroin and they found out that even after a long time of taking heroin, the brain still gets happy when it takes the drug. It's like the brain is still trying to get that happy feeling even after a while.\n\n\n\n",

SIRT could be repeated once in case of recurrence; while, TACE was repeated every 6 weeks until no viable tumor tissue was detected by MRI or contraindications prohibited further treatment. Patients were followed-up by MRI every 3 months; the final evaluation was 05/2013.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nBoth groups were comparable in demographics (SIRT: 8males/4females, mean age 72 \u00b1 7 years; TACE: 10males/2females, mean age 71 \u00b1 9 years), initial tumor load (1 patient \u226525 % in each group), and BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) stage (SIRT: 12\u00d7B; TACE 1\u00d7A, 11\u00d7B). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 180 days for SIRT versus 216 days for TACE patients (p = 0.6193) with a median TTP of 371 days versus 336 days, respectively (p = 0.5764). Median OS was 592 days for SIRT versus 788 days for TACE patients (p = 0.9271). Seven patients died in each group. Causes of death were liver failure (n = 4 SIRT group), tumor progression (n = 4 TACE group), cardiovascular events, and inconclusive (n = 1 in each group).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.\nNo significant differences were found in median PFS, OS, and TTP. The lower rate of tumor progression in the SIRT group was nullified by a greater incidence of liver failure. This pilot study is the first prospective randomized trial comparing SIRT and TACE for treating HCC, and results can be used for sample size calculations of future studies.",

SIRT could be repeated once in case of recurrence; while, TACE was repeated every 6 weeks until no viable tumor tissue was detected by MRI or contraindications prohibited further treatment. Patients were followed-up by MRI every 3 months; the final evaluation was 05/2013.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nBoth groups were comparable in demographics (SIRT: 8males/4females, mean age 72 \u00b1 7 years; TACE: 10males/2females, mean age 71 \u00b1 9 years), initial tumor load (1 patient \u226525 % in each group), and BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) stage (SIRT: 12\u00d7B; TACE 1\u00d7A, 11\u00d7B). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 180 days for SIRT versus 216 days for TACE patients (p = 0.6193) with a median TTP of 371 days versus 336 days, respectively (p = 0.5764). Median OS was 592 days for SIRT versus 788 days for TACE patients (p = 0.9271). Seven patients died in each group. Causes of death were liver failure (n = 4 SIRT group), tumor progression (n = 4 TACE group), cardiovascular events, and inconclusive (n = 1 in each group).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.\nNo significant differences were found in median PFS, OS, and TTP. The lower rate of tumor progression in the SIRT group was nullified by a greater incidence of liver failure. This pilot study is the first prospective randomized trial comparing SIRT and TACE for treating HCC, and results can be used for sample size calculations of future studies.",
        "target": "\nThe study compared two ways of treating liver cancer. One way is called SIRT, and the other way is called TACE. The study found out that the two ways are almost the same in terms of how long the cancer stays away, how long the patient lives, and how often the cancer comes back. The study also found that the patients who got SIRT had more liver problems, but the patients who got TACE had more cancer problems. The study was small, but it gives us information that we can use for future studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
