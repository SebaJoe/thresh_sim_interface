Serum-procalcitonin (PCT) can be used to guide treatment when bacterial infection is suspected. Its role in pediatric LRTI is unclear.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Between 01/2009 and 02/2010 we randomized previously healthy patients 1 month to 18 years old presenting with LRTI to the emergency departments of two pediatric hospitals in Switzerland to receive antibiotics either according to a PCT guidance algorithm established for adult LRTI or standard care clinical guidelines. In intention-to-treat analyses, antibiotic prescribing rate, duration of antibiotic treatment, and number of days with impairment of daily activities within 14 days of randomization were compared between the two groups.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: In total 337 children, mean age 3.8 years (range 0.1\u201318), were included. Antibiotic prescribing rates were not significantly different in PCT guided patients compared to controls (OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.81, 1.95). Mean duration of antibiotic exposure was reduced from 6.3 to 4.5 days under PCT guidance (\u22121.8 days; 95% CI \u22123.1, \u22120.5; P = 0.039) for all LRTI and from 9.1 to 5.7 days for pneumonia (\u22123.4 days 95% CI \u22124.9, \u22121.7; P<0.001). There was no apparent difference in impairment of daily activities between PCT guided and control patients.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: PCT guidance reduced antibiotic exposure by reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment, while not affecting the antibiotic prescribing rate. The latter may be explained by the low baseline prescribing rate in Switzerland for pediatric LRTI and the choice of an inappropriately low PCT cut-off level for this population.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN17057980 ISRCTN17057980\n",
        "target": "Simple Explanation:\n\nAntibiotics are sometimes used too often in children and teenagers suffering from infections in their lower respiratory system (the lungs and associated parts). They can be guided by a biological marker in the blood, called procalcitonin (PCT), where high levels often suggest bacterial infection. But, it's unclear how useful this is for these types of infections in children.\n\nIn our study, from 2009 to 2010, we selected healthy youngsters between 1 month and 18 years of age, who were showing signs of lower respiratory infections. They ended up in emergency departments of two Swiss children's hospitals. There, they were randomly chosen to join one of two groups. One group was given antibiotics based on their PCT levels, following a process developed for adults. The other group was treated according to standard guidelines.\n\nWe tracked 337 children, with an average age of about 4 years. We found no significant difference between the two groups in terms of whether antibiotics were given. However, we did see that the PCT-guided group was given antibiotics for fewer days. On average, this group was on this treatment for 4.5 days instead of 6.3. The same was true for those with pneumonia, who were on antibiotics for 5.7 days instead of 9.1. We didn't notice any difference in how the children's day-to-day activities were affected.\n\nIn conclusion, basing antibiotic use on PCT levels didn't seem to influence whether antibiotics were given, but it did shorten how long these medicines were used. The reason for the first finding might be that Switzerland generally uses fewer antibiotics for these types of infections in children. Or, the PCT level we used to decide on treatment could have been set too low for this age group.\n\nThis was a controlled trial, registered at Controlled-Trials.com under the number ISRCTN17057980.",
