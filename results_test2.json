        "target": "Simple Explanation:\n\nAntibiotics are sometimes used too often in children and teenagers suffering from infections in their lower respiratory system (the lungs and associated parts). They can be guided by a biological marker in the blood, called procalcitonin (PCT), where high levels often suggest bacterial infection. But, it's unclear how useful this is for these types of infections in children.\n\nIn our study, from 2009 to 2010, we selected healthy youngsters between 1 month and 18 years of age, who were showing signs of lower respiratory infections. They ended up in emergency departments of two Swiss children's hospitals. There, they were randomly chosen to join one of two groups. One group was given antibiotics based on their PCT levels, following a process developed for adults. The other group was treated according to standard guidelines.\n\nWe tracked 337 children, with an average age of about 4 years. We found no significant difference between the two groups in terms of whether antibiotics were given. However, we did see that the PCT-guided group was given antibiotics for fewer days. On average, this group was on this treatment for 4.5 days instead of 6.3. The same was true for those with pneumonia, who were on antibiotics for 5.7 days instead of 9.1. We didn't notice any difference in how the children's day-to-day activities were affected.\n\nIn conclusion, basing antibiotic use on PCT levels didn't seem to influence whether antibiotics were given, but it did shorten how long these medicines were used. The reason for the first finding might be that Switzerland generally uses fewer antibiotics for these types of infections in children. Or, the PCT level we used to decide on treatment could have been set too low for this age group.\n\nThis was a controlled trial, registered at Controlled-Trials.com under the number ISRCTN17057980.",

        "source": "Generating responses to tumor antigens poses a challenge for immunotherapy. This phase II trial (NCT02129075) tested fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) ligand pre-treatment enhancement of responses to dendritic cell (DC)-targeting vaccines. We evaluated a regimen of Flt3L (CDX-301) to increase DCs and other antigen-presenting cells, poly-ICLC (TLR3 agonist that activates DCs) and a vaccine comprising anti-DEC-205-NY-ESO-1, a fusion antibody targeting CD205, linked to NY-ESO-1. High-risk melanoma patients were randomized to vaccine, with and without CDX-301. The end point was immune response to NY-ESO-1. Flt3L increased peripheral monocytes and conventional DCs (cDCs), including cross-presenting cDC1 and cDC2 and plasmacytoid DCs. Significant increases in humoral and T-cell responses and activation of DCs, natural killer cells and T cells were elicited. Transcriptional analyses revealed gene signatures associated with CDX-301 induction of an early, durable immune response. This study reveals in vivo effects of Flt3L on innate immune cells in the setting of vaccination, leading to an immunogenic vaccine regimen."
