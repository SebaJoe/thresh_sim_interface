Serum-procalcitonin (PCT) can be used to guide treatment when bacterial infection is suspected. Its role in pediatric LRTI is unclear.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Between 01/2009 and 02/2010 we randomized previously healthy patients 1 month to 18 years old presenting with LRTI to the emergency departments of two pediatric hospitals in Switzerland to receive antibiotics either according to a PCT guidance algorithm established for adult LRTI or standard care clinical guidelines. In intention-to-treat analyses, antibiotic prescribing rate, duration of antibiotic treatment, and number of days with impairment of daily activities within 14 days of randomization were compared between the two groups.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: In total 337 children, mean age 3.8 years (range 0.1\u201318), were included. Antibiotic prescribing rates were not significantly different in PCT guided patients compared to controls (OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.81, 1.95). Mean duration of antibiotic exposure was reduced from 6.3 to 4.5 days under PCT guidance (\u22121.8 days; 95% CI \u22123.1, \u22120.5; P = 0.039) for all LRTI and from 9.1 to 5.7 days for pneumonia (\u22123.4 days 95% CI \u22124.9, \u22121.7; P&lt;0.001). There was no apparent difference in impairment of daily activities between PCT guided and control patients.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: PCT guidance reduced antibiotic exposure by reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment, while not affecting the antibiotic prescribing rate. The latter may be explained by the low baseline prescribing rate in Switzerland for pediatric LRTI and the choice of an inappropriately low PCT cut-off level for this population.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN17057980 ISRCTN17057980\n",
        "target": "Simple Explanation:\n\nAntibiotics are sometimes used too often in children and teenagers suffering from infections in their lower respiratory system (the lungs and associated parts). They can be guided by a biological marker in the blood, called procalcitonin (PCT), where high levels often suggest bacterial infection. But, it's unclear how useful this is for these types of infections in children.\n\nIn our study, from 2009 to 2010, we selected healthy youngsters between 1 month and 18 years of age, who were showing signs of lower respiratory infections. They ended up in emergency departments of two Swiss children's hospitals. There, they were randomly chosen to join one of two groups. One group was given antibiotics based on their PCT levels, following a process developed for adults. The other group was treated according to standard guidelines.\n\nWe tracked 337 children, with an average age of about 4 years. We found no significant difference between the two groups in terms of whether antibiotics were given. However, we did see that the PCT-guided group was given antibiotics for fewer days. On average, this group was on this treatment for 4.5 days instead of 6.3. The same was true for those with pneumonia, who were on antibiotics for 5.7 days instead of 9.1. We didn't notice any difference in how the children's day-to-day activities were affected.\n\nIn conclusion, basing antibiotic use on PCT levels didn't seem to influence whether antibiotics were given, but it did shorten how long these medicines were used. The reason for the first finding might be that Switzerland generally uses fewer antibiotics for these types of infections in children. Or, the PCT level we used to decide on treatment could have been set too low for this age group.\n\nThis was a controlled trial, registered at Controlled-Trials.com under the number ISRCTN17057980.",

However, a lack of clarity exists as to whether the tests are in fact able to detect changes in cognition.\n\nABSTRACT.AIM: To examine if the continuous reaction time test (CRT) can detect changes in cognition with anti-HE intervention in patients with cirrhosis and without clinically manifest hepatic encephalopathy (HE).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Firstly, we conducted a reproducibility analysis and secondly measured change in CRT induced by anti-HE treatment in a randomized controlled pilot study: We stratified 44 patients with liver cirrhosis and without clinically manifest HE according to a normal (n = 22) or abnormal (n = 22) CRT. Each stratum was then block randomized to receive multimodal anti-HE intervention (lactulose+branched-chain amino acids+rifaximin) or triple placebos for 3 months in a double-blinded fashion. The CRT is a simple PC-based test and the test result, the CRT index (normal threshold &gt; 1.9), describes the patient's stability of alertness during the 10\u2013minute test. Our study outcome was the change in CRT index in each group at study exit. The portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE) test, a paper-and-pencil test battery (normal threshold above -5), was used as a comparator test according to international guidelines.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The patients with an abnormal CRT index who were randomized to receive the active intervention normalized or improved their CRT index (mean change 0.92 \u00b1 0.29, p = 0.01). Additionally, their PSE improved (change 3.85 \u00b1 1.83, p = 0.03). There was no such effect in any of the other study groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with liver cirrhosis and no manifest HE, the CRT identified a group in whom cognition improved with intensive anti-HE intervention. This finding infers that the CRT can detect a response to treatment and might help in selecting patients for treatment.",
        "target": "Simplified version:\n\nThis study was about a condition called Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy (MHE), which is a subtle problem in the brain caused by liver disease but doesn't show any symptoms and can only be diagnosed by performing certain brain performance tests. There's a bit of confusion about whether these tests really do find small changes in brain function. \n\nWe were testing to see if a particular exam, known as the continuous reaction time test (CRT), could pick up changes in brain performance in patients who have a kind of liver disease called cirrhosis but no obvious signs of brain problems (HE for short). \n\nWhat we did was two parts: first we made sure the test gave consistent results, and then we saw if the test results changed before and after a specific treatment in a small, controlled trial. We randomly gave 44 cirrhosis patients a treatment mix of different things (lactulose, amino acids, and rifaximin) or a placebo (a harmless substance with no treatment effect) for 3 months. The CRT involves patients' response time to computer prompts and measures their alertness. We compared any change in patient's scores on CRT and another traditional test for HE called PSE. \n\nOur findings showed that the group with abnormal CRT scores who got the actual treatment saw their scores improve or go back to normal, and their PSE scores improved as well. This didn't happen in any of the other groups. \n\nTherefore, in patients with liver cirrhosis who don't show clear symptoms of brain trouble, the CRT can help identify who may improve with this treatment blend. This suggests that the CRT can register improvements from treatment and could be useful to decide which patients should receive the treatment.",

The blood sugar reduction was almost the same in both groups, and a similar number of patients achieved good blood sugar control. However, more patients treated with detemir reached a tighter control of blood sugar. The risk of low blood sugar was the same for both treatments, but the glargine group gained slightly more weight. Importantly, those who took glargine needed lower doses compared to the ones taking detemir.\n\nTo sum up, in patients with type 2 diabetes who had never used insulin before, glargine was as effective as detemir in controlling blood sugar levels, but it caused a bit more weight gain and needed lower doses.",
