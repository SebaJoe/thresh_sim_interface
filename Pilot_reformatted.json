We also explored the role of education and income on responses to these measures.\n\nMETHODS\nThis cross-sectional study used baseline data from PROACTIVE, a cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate a psychosocial intervention for late-life depression among older adults. Participants aged \u226560 years with a 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire score \u226510 were recruited from 20 primary healthcare clinics. Ordered logistic regression models assessed the association between depressive symptoms severity, income, and education and dimension-level responses on the EQ-5D-5L and ICECAP-O. Multivariable regression models investigated the ability of EQ-5D-5L and ICECAP-O scores to discriminate between depressive symptoms severity levels and other characteristics, including education level and household income.\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 715 participants were included in the study. Depressive symptoms severity was associated with all EQ-5D-5L and ICECAP-O dimensions, except the ICECAP-O enjoyment attribute. In contrast, household income was only associated with the ICECAP-O security attribute. Higher severity of depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire scores) was also strongly associated with lower (ie, worse) scores on both measures in all models. Education level and household income showed no association with either EQ-5D-5L or ICECAP-O scores.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo best of our knowledge, this is the first study that investigated the validity of these 2 measures among older adults in Brazil. Both EQ-5D-5L and ICECAP-O showed evidence of validity in differentiating depressive symptom severity.\n"

        "source": "BACKGROUND\nFalls are a major public health problem. Fear of falling is highly prevalent amongst community-dwelling older adults who have already fallen and it is also a risk factor for recurrent falls. There has been limited research about the impact that exercises programs have on the fear of falling. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the Otago Exercise Programme (OEP) reduced the fear of falling in non-institutionalised people aged 65-80 years in Spain. It also evaluated the factors associated with the fear of falling.\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a quasi-experimental study that focused on people aged 65-80 who attended 21 primary healthcare centres, lived in the community, were able to walk independently and provided written, informed consent. They were recruited from September 2017 to December 2019. The OEP sessions took place at the primary healthcare centres and were provided on an individual or group basis by trained OEP instructors. The participants attended five weekly sessions, where they were given exercises to develop their strength, balance and endurance. They then continued the programme at home. The subjects were followed up 12 months after baseline and the analyses included a bivariate analysis and a multivariate analysis with logistic regression.\n\nRESULTS\nWe enroled 498 patients (67.07% female) with an average age of 71.81 years. More than two-thirds (65.06%) lived with a partner and 42.37% were overweight. Significant reductions were observed in the mean level of fear of falling between baseline and 12 months (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000). A number of factors associated with fear of falling also showed significant differences. These were: age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.033), sex (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000), living alone (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000), body mass index (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and whether psychotropic drugs were used (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000). The multivariate analysis showed a moderate to high fear of falling amongst participants who were female (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000), 72-80 years of age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017), obese (p\u00a0=\u00a00.045) and used psychotropic drugs (p\u00a0=\u00a00.021).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTaking part in the OEP reduced the overall fear of falling. There were significant associations between fear of falling and being female, taking psychotic drugs and having a history of falls. This study is a quasi-experimental sign nested an experimental study (randomized controlled trial previously published and registered on ClinicalTrials.org (NCT03320668)).

Semaglutide and dulaglutide, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, are indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). GLP-1 receptor agonists have recently shown to reduce cardiovascular risk. Epicardial adipose tissue expresses GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1Rs). GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide is known to significantly decrease EAT thickness. However, the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists semaglutide and dulaglutide on EAT thickness are unknown.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe performed a 12-week, controlled, parallel study in 80 subjects with T2DM and obesity. Patients received either semaglutide, up to 1 mg subcutaneous (sc) weekly, or dulaglutide, up to 1.5 mg sc weekly, as the standard of care in addition to their usual medication regimen. Twenty subjects with T2DM and obesity were started on metformin and a diet and served as the control group. Ultrasound-measured EAT thickness was measured at baseline and at the 12-week follow-up.\n\nRESULTS\nEpicardial adipose tissue thickness significantly decreased in both semaglutide and dulaglutide groups ( P \u2005&lt;\u20050.001) after 12 weeks, accounting for a 20% reduction. There was no EAT reduction in the metformin group. Body mass index (BMI) and HbA1c improved in all groups without reaching statistical significance. Epicardial adipose tissue thickness reduction was significantly greater ( P \u2005&lt;\u20050.01) with the higher doses of semaglutide (1 mg) and dulaglutide (1.5 mg), respectively.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWeekly administration of either GLP-1 receptor agonists semaglutide or dulaglutide causes a rapid, substantial, and dose-dependent reduction in EAT thickness.\n"

        "source": "INTRODUCTION\nE-cigarette studies have found that the use of a variety of flavors and customizable devices results in greater use frequency and user satisfaction. However, standardized research e-cigarettes are being developed as closed systems with limited flavor options, potentially limiting user satisfaction. In this study, we explore protocol compliance in an e-cigarette study using a standardized, assigned device with puff time and duration tracking (controlled e-cigarette) and potential limitations that controlled devices and e-liquids can introduce.\n\nMETHODS\nIn a crossover study, 49 young adult e-cigarette users were recruited using convenience sampling and assigned a controlled e-cigarette device and flavored or unflavored e-liquids on standardized protocols. E-cigarette use frequency (number of puffs per day, collected from the device) and serum cotinine levels were obtained at each of three study visits over 3 weeks. The correlation of cotinine and e-cigarette use over the preceding week was calculated at each study visit.\n\nRESULTS\nCorrelation of nicotine intake, as measured by serum cotinine, and puff time, as measured by puffs count and duration from the e-cigarette device, as an indicator of study protocol compliance, substantially declined after the first week of the study and were no longer correlated in the remaining study weeks (R2 = 0.53 and p \u2264 .01 in week 1, R2 &lt; 0.5 and p &gt; .05 for remaining weeks).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is an emerging need for controlled e-cigarette exposures studies, but low compliance in the use of assigned devices and e-liquids may be a limitation that needs to be mitigated in future studies.\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nThis study is the first to analyze compliance with instructions to use a standardized e-cigarette device with puff time and duration tracking (controlled e-cigarette) across all subjects and an assigned e-liquid flavor over a 3-week period. We find that protocol compliance, as measured by correlations between e-cigarette use measures and cotinine levels, was only achieved in the first week of the study and declined thereafter. These findings indicate that the assignment of a study device and instruction to only use the study device with assigned e-liquid flavor may not be sufficient to ensure participant compliance with the study protocol. We suggest that additional measures, including behavioral and biological markers, are needed to ensure sole use of the study e-cigarette and e-liquid and to be able to interpret results from controlled e-cigarette studies.\n"

The insertion success rate of the I-Gel\u00ae was 92.9% at the first attempt, the mean capnometric values were 16.3mmHg in the control group and 27.4% in the intervention group. 34.8% (n=8) of the patients achieved spontaneous circulation recovery at some point and 26.1% (n=6) were admitted to hospital alive. The survival analysis, taking into account the arrival of the unit and the first minute of ventilations recorded together with the variable hospital admission, suggests a certain trend of greater survival in the intervention branch (P=.066).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe use of I-Gel\u00ae raises an improvement in the ventilation of the patients in PCR, evidenced by the mean capnometric values in the intervention group, finding no correlation with CPR outcome variables.\n"

We hypothesized that colchicine, a potent anti-inflammatory agent, may reduce infarct size (IS) and left ventricular (LV) remodeling at the acute phase of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction.\n\nMETHODS\nIn this double-blind multicenter trial, we randomly assigned patients admitted for a first episode of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention to receive oral colchicine (2-mg loading dose followed by 0.5 mg twice a day) or matching placebo from admission to day 5. The primary efficacy outcome was IS determined by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at 5 days. The relative LV end-diastolic volume change at 3 months and IS at 3 months assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were among the secondary outcomes.\n\nRESULTS\nWe enrolled 192 patients, 101 in the colchicine group and 91 in the control group. At 5 days, the gadolinium enhancement-defined IS did not differ between the colchicine and placebo groups with a mean of 26 interquartile range (IQR) [16-44] versus 28.4 IQR [14-40] g of LV mass, respectively ( P =0.87). At 3 months follow-up, there was no significant difference in LV remodeling between the colchicine and placebo groups with a +2.4% (IQR, -8.3% to 11.1%) versus -1.1% (IQR, -8.0% to 9.9%) change in LV end-diastolic volume ( P =0.49). Infarct size at 3 months was also not significantly different between the colchicine and placebo groups (17 IQR [10-28] versus 18 IQR [10-27] g of LV mass, respectively;  P =0.92). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events during the treatment period was greater with colchicine than with placebo (34% versus 11%, respectively;  P =0.0002).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, oral administration of high-dose colchicine at the time of reperfusion and for 5 days did not reduce IS assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

        "source": "INTRODUCTION\nUbrogepant is a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist indicated for acute treatment of migraine that can be used to treat breakthrough attacks in individuals taking preventive treatment for migraine. We evaluated the impact of preventive medication use on the efficacy and safety of ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine.\n\nMETHODS\nThis was an analysis of pooled efficacy data from the ACHIEVE\u00a0I and ACHIEVE\u00a0II phase\u00a03 trials, in which efficacy of ubrogepant was assessed at 2\u00a0h after taking study medication for pain freedom, absence of most bothersome symptom (MBS), and pain relief. In addition, a long-term safety (LTS) extension trial was completed where safety was assessed on the basis of incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Outcomes were compared between participants with or without prior (within 6\u00a0months) preventive medication use (anticonvulsants, beta blockers, antidepressants, or onabotulinumtoxinA). For efficacy analyses, data were pooled across ACHIEVE trials for the 50\u00a0mg and placebo groups; for safety analyses, data for all dose groups (50\u00a0mg and 100\u00a0mg) in the LTS trial were pooled.\n\nRESULTS\nPreventive treatments were used by 417 of 2247 (18.6%) participants analyzed in the ACHIEVE trials and by 143 of 813 (17.5%) participants in the LTS trial. Responder rates for all outcomes were similar between participants with or without preventive treatment within each dose group (p\u2009&gt;\u20090.05). No significant differences were noted across the different preventive medications. Rates and types of TEAEs were similar between participants with or without preventive treatment. No serious treatment-related adverse events were reported.\n\nCONCLUSION\nEfficacy and safety of ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine were similar between participants with or without prior or current use of concomitant preventive medication.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02828020 (ACHIEVE\u00a0I), NCT02867709 (ACHIEVE\u00a0II), and NCT02873221 (long-term safety trial).\n"

Patients in this exploratory analysis of a prespecified subgroup had confirmed diagnoses of both CM and MOH at screening. Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous eptinezumab 100, 300\u00a0mg, or placebo every 12\u00a0weeks. Efficacy outcomes included mean changes from baseline in monthly migraine days (MMDs) during weeks 1-12, migraine responder rates at week 12, and percentages of patients below International Classification of Headache Disorders thresholds for CM and MOH over weeks 1-24.\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 431 patients who were diagnosed with CM and MOH as specified in the protocol and received eptinezumab 100\u00a0mg (n\u00a0=\u00a0139), 300\u00a0mg (n\u00a0=\u00a0147), or placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a0145). During the baseline period, these patients experienced an average of 16.7 migraine days across treatment arms. Over weeks 1-12, eptinezumab-treated patients experienced greater reductions from baseline in MMDs than placebo patients (100\u00a0mg, change from baseline\u00a0=\u00a0-8.4, difference from placebo [95% confidence interval (CI)]\u00a0=\u00a0-3.0 [-4.56, -1.52], p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001 vs. placebo; 300\u00a0mg, change from baseline\u00a0=\u00a0-8.6, difference from placebo [95% CI]\u00a0=\u00a0-3.2 [-4.66, -1.78], p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001 vs. placebo; placebo, -5.4).

Therapeutic benefits with eptinezumab were observed from day 1 after dosing, and improvements were sustained with an additional dose. For the full 24-week treatment period, 71/139 (51.1%), 80/147 (54.4%), and 47/145 (32.4%) of 100, 300\u00a0mg, and placebo-treated patients, respectively, were below CM thresholds, and of the patients who provided sufficient acute medication data, 47/93 (50.5%), 53/107 (49.5%), and 26/96 (27.1%), respectively, were below medication-overuse thresholds.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients diagnosed with both CM and MOH, eptinezumab treatment resulted in greater reductions in MMDs, higher responder rates, and fewer patients meeting CM and MOH criteria, thus demonstrating the efficacy and clinical utility of eptinezumab in this patient population.\n"

The results showed that the % excess weight loss (EWL) was higher in group 1 (82.9%) compared to group 2 (73.5%) at the end of the first year (p=0.003). There were no significant differences in terms of nausea and vomiting between the two groups. The results of this study suggest that starting antrectomy at a distance of 1 cm or less from the pylorus in LSG provides effective weight loss without increasing complications.&lt;/s&gt;",

Patients were divided into one of the two groups based on the distance between the pylorus and the resection margin: group 1 having resection \u226410 mm and group 2 at 11-20 mm. Above mentioned parameters were compared in both groups.\n\nRESULTS\nNinety-two patients were included. Postoperative nausea and vomiting rates were similar in both groups. At the end of the first year, % EWL was 82.9% and 73.5% in groups 1 and 2 (p=0.003).\n\nCONCLUSION\nStarting antrectomy at a distance of 2 cm or less from the pylorus is safe and effective. Starting antrectomy at a distance of 1 cm or less from the pylorus in LSG provides effective weight loss without increasing complications.\n\nKEY WORDS\nBariatric surgery, Antrectomy, Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, Complications.\n"
