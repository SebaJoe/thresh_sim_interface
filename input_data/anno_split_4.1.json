        "target": "Sure, this passage is talking about an experiment that doctors did to learn how food and insulin affect blood sugar and blood platelets in people with type 2 diabetes. \n\nPeople with diabetes have more sugar in their blood after they eat a meal, and this can make their blood platelets (tiny particles in our blood that help it clot or stick together) more active. The doctors wanted to see if giving insulin before the meal could change this. They tried giving some patients insulin and others a placebo, which is like a fake medicine, before they ate. \n\nThey found out that insulin did lower the amount of sugar in the blood after eating. Still, it also made the platelets even more active than before. The sugar didn't seem to be the cause for this, it was the insulin. \n\nSo, this study helps us understand that it's the insulin, not just the sugar, that can make platelets more active in people with type 2 diabetes after they eat. \n\nIt's like if you put a bunch of hyper kids in a room - if you give them candy (sugar), they get hyper, but if you add in some more intense games too (insulin), they get even more hyper. In this case, the blood platelets are the hyper kids.",

The rest of the women were put in a hospital group where they were given a medicine to make labor start.\n\nThe study found out that the home treatment group stayed less time in the hospital before the baby was born, they felt less pain, and also got more sleep. But, they had to get more medicine to help their labor progress. The hospital group women delivered a bit faster after they went into active labor. But, overall both groups were pretty close in how long it took from the time labor was started until the baby was born, and the number of women who had vaginal births wasn't very different.\n\nSo, the doctors concluded that both treatments are acceptable and safe.

The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility, clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter (OPC) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 (IP) for induction of labour (IOL) at term.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS.\nWomen with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term (N = 101) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter (OPC, n = 50) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 (IP, n = 51). OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph. IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous. Main outcome measures were inpatient stay (prior to birth, in Birthing Unit, total), mode of birth, induction to delivery interval, adverse reactions and patient satisfaction.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nOPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth (21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs, p &lt; .001), IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit (53% vs. 28%, p = .01). Vaginal birth rates (66% OPC Vs. 71% IP), total induction to delivery time (33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs) and total inpatient times (96 hrs OPC Vs. 105 hrs IP) were similar. OPC group felt less pain (significant discomfort 26% Vs 58%, p = .003), and had more sleep (5.8 Vs 3.4 hours, p &lt; .001), during cervical preparation, but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL (88 Vs 59%, p = .001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.\nOPC was feasible and acceptable for IOL of women with an unfavourable cervix at term compared to IP, however did not show a statistically significant reduction in total inpatient stay and was associated with increased oxytocin IOL.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN:12609000420246.",
        "target": "\nThis study looked at how two different ways of inducing labor (IOL) compare. One way is called outpatient IOL and the other is called inpatient IOL. The study found that the outpatient way is just as good as the inpatient way, but it doesn't make you stay in the hospital as long. The outpatient way also makes you feel less pain and sleep more during the preparation time, but you are more likely to need extra medicine to help labor progress.\n\n\n",

But for the people who got ranibizumab, there was a slight decrease in these extra vessels after a week, but no notable change after a month. \n\nSo, from this one test, it looked like bevacizumab might do a better job than ranibizumab in treating this condition. However, the doctors said that they still have to look into it more to know the exact amount and strength of each medicine needed to best treat this condition.",

The patients were prospectively followed-up for one month after the injections. Corneal NV areas, as shown on corneal slit-lamp photographs stored in JPEG format, were calculated using Image J software before the injection, one week after the injection, and one month after the injection. The corneal NV areas were compared before and after the injections.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nSeven women and nine men, with an average age of 51 years, presented with corneal NV secondary to herpetic keratitis (7 cases), graft rejection (6), chemical burn (1), pemphigoid (1), and recurrent ulcer (1). In group I, the preoperative corneal NV area (8.75 \u00b1 4.33%) was significantly decreased to 5.62 \u00b1 3.86% one week after the injection and to 6.35 \u00b1 3.02% one month after the injection (p = 0.012, 0.012, respectively). The corneal NV area in group 2 also exhibited a significant change, from 7.37 \u00b1 4.33% to 6.72 \u00b1 4.16% one week after the injection (p = 0.012). However, no significant change was observed one month after the injection. The mean decrease in corneal NV area one month after injection in group 1 (28.4 \u00b1 9.01%) was significantly higher than in group 2 (4.51 \u00b1 11.64%, p = 0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.\nBevacizumab injection resulted in a more effective and stable regression of corneal NV compared to the ranibizumab injection. The potency and dose of these two drugs for the regression of corneal NV require further investigation.",
        "target": "\nThis study compared two different medicines for treating a condition called corneal neovascularization (NV). Corneal NV is when new blood vessels grow into the cornea, which is the clear part of the eye. The two medicines used in this study were bevacizumab and ranibizumab. The researchers found that bevacizumab worked better and faster than ranibizumab in reducing the size of the corneal NV. Bevacizumab also kept working better after one month, while ranibizumab did not. This means that doctors may want to use bevacizumab more often to treat corneal NV.",

The sugar drink also caused the fat oxidation rate to be lower than the control group during the exercise. The sugar drink also caused the participants' plasma free fatty acid levels to be lower than the control group at 30, 45, and 60 minutes.

They studied 8 people, half of them given food (sugar from glucose dissolved in water) and half of them just water before they walked on a treadmill for an hour. They found that people who had food before exercising had more growth hormones in their blood than those who only had water. However, they also found that people who ate before exercising burned less fat during exercise. They also found that their blood sugar was lower, and insulin (a hormone that controls blood sugar levels) was higher. This suggests that eating before you do light exercise doesn't necessarily help you burn more fat, even though it might increase growth hormones in your blood.",

After initial screening the subjects were randomized into four groups with 15 per group. The four groups received, respectively, placebo, omega-3 fatty acid, probiotic VSL#3, or both omega-3 and probiotic, for 6 weeks. Blood and fecal samples were collected at baseline and after 6 weeks. The probiotic (VSL#3) supplemented group had significant reduction in total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL, and VLDL and had increased HDL (P &lt; 0.05) value.

After 6 weeks, they found that the group taking the special bacteria had better levels of fat in their blood, better sugar control, and less inflammation. The fish oil also helped with sugar control and inflammation but not with bacteria in the gut. When both the fish oil and bacteria were taken together, they worked even better. Also, those people who had bad fat levels, bad sugar control and more inflammation had less good bacteria and more bad bacteria in their gut.",

They tested these supplements on 60 healthy adults between the ages of 40 and 60. They divided the participants into four groups and gave each group a different supplement for six weeks. They took blood and stool samples before and after the six weeks to see how the supplements affected the body. The group that took probiotics (VSL#3) had lower levels of bad cholesterol (LDL and VLDL) and higher levels of good cholesterol (HDL). They also had better insulin sensitivity, which means their body used insulin (a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar) better. The group that took omega-3 fatty acids had better insulin sensitivity and lower levels of a protein called C-reactive protein (hsCRP), which is a sign of inflammation in the body. When they added omega-3 fatty acids to the probiotics, the combination had an even greater effect on HDL cholesterol, insulin sensitivity, and hsCRP. The study also found that people with low levels of good bacteria in their gut and high levels of bad bacteria had more health problems.\n",

They tested this method over 4 days and compared it against a common mouthwash named chlorhexidine and against just plain salty water (that was like a fake mouthwash they used just to compare).\n\nThey had 300 healthy people split into 3 groups for this experiment. Each group used a different mouthwash: one with Aloe vera, one with chlorhexidine, and one with salty water. Before this, the scientists cleaned every person's teeth professionally so that everyone would start off with the same, clean slate. The people were then asked not to clean their teeth and to only use the given mouthwash for 4 days.\n\nAt the end of the experiment, the scientists saw that the Aloe vera mouthwash worked just as well as the common chlorhexidine mouthwash in getting rid of plaque. The people using either the Aloe vera or chlorhexidine had less plaque than those using the plain salty water. Also, no one had any problems using the Aloe vera mouthwash.\n\nSo, the scientists concluded that Aloe vera could be a good alternative to the commonly used mouthwash because it helps get rid of plaque in the mouth without causing any trouble.",

Trend of SBP, DBP, HR and MAP between groups were not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05).\n\nIn conclusion, infusion of hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 ml/kg) before the general anesthesia led to a useful reduction in MAP and reduced heart rate, with no episodes of severe hypotension.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt;",

        "target": "This study was checking if giving a special type of salt water to patients before surgery could prevent their blood pressure from dropping too low when they are put to sleep for the operation. They found that the extra salty water did stop some patients' blood pressure from getting too low, and also kept their heart rate steady, without causing any major problems. This might help patients do better during and after surgery.",
