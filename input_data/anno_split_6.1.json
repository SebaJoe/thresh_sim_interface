        "target": "This study compared two medications, buprenorphine and dihydrocodeine, for the detoxification of illicit opiates in primary care. Of the 60 participants recruited, 23% completed the prescribed course of medication and provided a urine sample on collection of their final prescription. Those allocated to buprenorphine were more likely to complete the detoxification regimen and provided a clean urine sample compared to those who received dihydrocodeine. Furthermore, those allocated to buprenorphine had fewer visits to professional carers during detoxification and more were abstinent at three and six months post detoxification. These results suggest that buprenorphine may be a more effective and efficient treatment for detoxification from illicit opiates in primary care.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt;",

        "target": "This is a study where scientists tried to help people who were using harmful drugs to stop. To do this, they gave them two different medications, buprenorphine and dihydrocodeine, to see which one works better. They found out that people who took buprenorphine were more likely to finish the treatment and to stop using the harmful drugs, compared to those who took dihydrocodeine. Also, those who took buprenorphine needed less help from doctors during the treatment, and more of them were still off the harmful drugs three and six months later. The scientists concluded that we can learn a lot from doing studies like this in regular doctor's offices with people who use drugs. This study is important because it gives us first-hand information on how these treatments work.",

As the sitagliptin clinical development program continues, additional studies with sitagliptin have been completed. The present analysis updates the safety and tolerability assessment of sitagliptin by examining pooled data from 25 double-blind clinical studies.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:\nThe present analysis included data from 14,611 patients in 25 studies with T2DM who received either sitagliptin 100\u00a0mg/day (n\u00a0=\u00a07,726; sitagliptin group) or a comparator agent (n\u00a0=\u00a06,885; non-exposed group). These studies represent all randomized, double-blind trials conducted by Merck that included patients treated with the usual clinical dose of sitagliptin (100\u00a0mg/day) for between 12\u00a0weeks and 2\u00a0years, and for which results were available as of December 2011. These studies assessed sitagliptin, versus comparator agents, taken as monotherapy, initial combination therapy with metformin or pioglitazone, or as add-on combination therapy with other antihyperglycemic agents (metformin, pioglitazone, a sulfonylurea\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0metformin, insulin\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0metformin, or metformin\u00a0+\u00a0pioglitazone or rosiglitazone). Patient-level data from each study were used to evaluate between-group differences in the exposure-adjusted incidence rates of adverse events (AEs).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:\nOverall incidence rates of AEs and drug-related AEs were higher in the non-exposed group compared with the sitagliptin group. Incidence rates of specific AEs were generally similar between the two groups, except for higher incidence rates of hypoglycemia related to the greater use of a sulfonylurea and diarrhea related to the greater use of metformin in the non-exposed group, and of constipation in the sitagliptin group. Treatment with sitagliptin was not associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, malignancy, or pancreatitis.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:\nIn this updated pooled safety analysis of data from 14,611 patients with T2DM, sitagliptin 100\u00a0mg/day was generally well tolerated in clinical trials of up to 2\u00a0years in duration.",

As the sitagliptin clinical development program continues, additional studies with sitagliptin have been completed. The present analysis updates the safety and tolerability assessment of sitagliptin by examining pooled data from 25 double-blind clinical studies.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:\nThe present analysis included data from 14,611 patients in 25 studies with T2DM who received either sitagliptin 100\u00a0mg/day (n\u00a0=\u00a07,726; sitagliptin group) or a comparator agent (n\u00a0=\u00a06,885; non-exposed group). These studies represent all randomized, double-blind trials conducted by Merck that included patients treated with the usual clinical dose of sitagliptin (100\u00a0mg/day) for between 12\u00a0weeks and 2\u00a0years, and for which results were available as of December 2011. These studies assessed sitagliptin, versus comparator agents, taken as monotherapy, initial combination therapy with metformin or pioglitazone, or as add-on combination therapy with other antihyperglycemic agents (metformin, pioglitazone, a sulfonylurea\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0metformin, insulin\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0metformin, or metformin\u00a0+\u00a0pioglitazone or rosiglitazone). Patient-level data from each study were used to evaluate between-group differences in the exposure-adjusted incidence rates of adverse events (AEs).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:\nOverall incidence rates of AEs and drug-related AEs were higher in the non-exposed group compared with the sitagliptin group. Incidence rates of specific AEs were generally similar between the two groups, except for higher incidence rates of hypoglycemia related to the greater use of a sulfonylurea and diarrhea related to the greater use of metformin in the non-exposed group, and of constipation in the sitagliptin group. Treatment with sitagliptin was not associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, malignancy, or pancreatitis.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:\nIn this updated pooled safety analysis of data from 14,611 patients with T2DM, sitagliptin 100\u00a0mg/day was generally well tolerated in clinical trials of up to 2\u00a0years in duration.",
        "target": "Merck, a medicine company, did 25 studies on a diabetes medicine called sitagliptin. They tested it on 14,611 people who had type 2 diabetes. The tests showed that sitagliptin didn't cause as many side effects or health problems as other diabetes medicines. The side effects it did cause were mostly constipation. But compared to other medicines, it didn't cause more serious problems like heart issues, cancer, or pancreatitis. So, sitagliptin seems to be a safer choice for treating type 2 diabetes.",

After this, they looked at everyone's thoughts about suicide and their quality of life. They found that the group that got the special mental health care had less suicidal thoughts and better quality of life.

The subjects were assigned to two random groups, and they received one tablet of placebo or rosehip that contained 100 mg of rosehip extract once each day for 12 weeks with no dietary intervention. Abdominal fat area and body fat percent were measured as primary outcomes. The other outcomes were body weight and body mass index.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:\nAbdominal total fat area, abdominal visceral fat area, body weight, and body mass index decreased significantly in the rosehip group at week 12 compared with their baseline levels (P&lt;0.01) after receiving the rosehip tablet intake, and the decreases in these parameters were significantly higher when compared with those in the placebo group. Additionally, body fat percent tended to decrease compared with the placebo group and their baseline level. Moreover, the abdominal subcutaneous fat area was significantly lower in the rosehip group than in the placebo group at week 12 after the initiation of intake (P&lt;0.05). In addition, there were no abnormalities, subjective symptoms, and findings that may indicate clinical problems during the study period.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:\nThese results suggest that rosehip extract may be a good candidate food material for preventing obesity.",
        "target": "\nThe study found that taking rosehip extract for 12 weeks helped people lose weight and reduce their body fat. The study showed that taking rosehip extract was more effective than taking a placebo (a dummy pill with no medicine in it). The people in the rosehip group lost more weight and had less body fat than the people in the placebo group. The study also found that taking rosehip extract did not cause any problems or side effects.\n\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

Previous studies indicated that using earplugs and eye masks can improve REM sleep in healthy subjects in simulated ICU environment, and improve sleep quality in ICU patients. This study aimed to determine the effects of using earplugs and eye masks with relaxing background music on sleep, melatonin and cortisol levels in ICU patients.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:\nFifty patients who underwent a scheduled cardiac surgery and were expected to stay at least 2 nights in Cardiac Surgical ICU (CSICU) were included. They were randomized to sleep with or without earplugs and eye masks combined with 30-minute relaxing music during the postoperative nights in CSICU.

The researchers used earplugs, eye masks, and music to see if it would improve sleep quality. They also looked at the levels of two chemicals in the body that can tell a lot about a person's sleep - melatonin and cortisol. What they found is that people who had earplugs, eye masks, and music did sleep better, but the levels of melatonin and cortisol didn't really change. This means that while these methods can help with sleep, they may not affect the body's natural sleep chemicals a whole lot.",

The serum levels of CagA, interleukin (IL)-10, E-selectin, TNF-\u03b1, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the ages and serum H. pylori CagA levels among the three groups, as well as both the mean drinking age and the mean daily alcohol consumption between groups A and B, were matched and comparable. Comparing the BMIs among the three groups, the BMI differences were found to be statistically significant (F=3.921, P&lt;0.05). Compared with group C, the BMIs in groups A and B were significantly higher (P&lt;0.001 and P&lt;0.01, respectively); however, the BMI differences between group A and group B were not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05).

        "source": "ABSTRACT.\nDifferent amounts of ingested alcohol can have distinct effects on the human body. However, there is limited research on chronic alcohol consumption with Helicobacter pylori infection. We sought to investigate the relationship between the cytokine profile, oxidative balance and H. pylori infection in subjects with chronic alcohol consumption. A total of 142 subjects were divided into three groups: 59 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion and H. pylori infection (group A); 53 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion without H. pylori infection (group B); and 30 control subjects (group C). The serum levels of CagA, interleukin (IL)-10, E-selectin, TNF-\u03b1, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the ages and serum H. pylori CagA levels among the three groups, as well as both the mean drinking age and the mean daily alcohol consumption between groups A and B, were matched and comparable. Comparing the BMIs among the three groups, the BMI differences were found to be statistically significant (F=3.921, P&lt;0.05). Compared with group C, the BMIs in groups A and B were significantly higher (P&lt;0.001 and P&lt;0.01, respectively); however, the BMI differences between group A and group B were not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05). Additionally, no differences in the serum CagA levels were found in comparisons among the groups (all P&gt;0.05). The serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (serum IL-10: P&lt;0.05; E-selectin: P&lt;0.05). The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C (P&lt;0.01); the serum E-selectin levels in group A did not significantly differ compared with those in group C (P&gt;0.05). Furthermore, the serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group B were significantly higher than those in group C (serum IL-10: P&lt;0.001; E-selectin: P&lt;0.05); however, the serum TNF-\u03b1 levels did not differ among groups (all P&gt;0.05). Although the serum levels of MDA and SOD in groups A and B were slightly lower than those in group C, there were no significant differences among groups (all P&gt;0.05). In conclusion, we believe that H. pylori infection might cause a significant inhibition of certain cytokine profiles in subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion. Moreover, chronically ingested alcohol may exert an adjusted inflammatory effect, but there was no association between H. pylori infection, chronic alcohol consumption and oxidative balance.",
        "target": "This is a scientific study summary. Scientists wanted to see if drinking alcohol a lot over a long time affected people differently if they had an infection from a germ called H. pylori. They studied 142 people, some who have the infection and drink alcohol, some who drink alcohol but don't have the infection, and a group who were healthy, which they used as a control or comparison group. \n\nThey examined everyone's blood to measure certain things that can show how your body reacts to infections and alcohol. They didn't find a huge difference in those measures between those with the infection and those without the infection who consume alcohol. Basically, the researchers found that having this infection, while also drinking alcohol chronically, affects some of the substances your body produces to fight off diseases. However, drinking alcohol alone or having the infection alone does not seem to affect the body's ability to stay balanced. \n\nIn simpler terms, scientists found out that drinking a lot of alcohol over time can affect some of your body's alarms (those substances they measured) if you have this specific germ. But, just drinking alcohol a lot or just having the infection doesn't seem to throw your body's balance off.",

        "target": "The study found that people who drink alcohol every day for a long time have different levels of certain chemicals in their body compared to people who only drink occasionally. The study also found that people who have a bug called Helicobacter pylori in their stomach might have lower levels of some of these chemicals. The study didn't find any connection between the bug and the way the body responds to alcohol. So, it seems that drinking alcohol every day for a long time can affect the body's response to the bug, but the bug itself doesn't seem to affect how the body responds to alcohol.",
