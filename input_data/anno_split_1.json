They compared it to a fake medicine and kept track of how much pain the people felt and how often they felt it. After 12 weeks, they didn't see a big difference between the group that got the real medicine and the group that got the fake one, meaning the medicine didn't really work better than no medicine at all.

        "target": "This study is about seeing how well a certain type of dental surgery works. The surgery places fake teeth, or implants, in people's mouths without cutting the gums which need to hold them. The researchers wanted to compare two different methods:\n\n1. Putting in the implant and pretending it's a real tooth right away (as in, the patient begins to use it for eating etc. immediately).\n2. Putting in the implant and waiting for four months before it's used like a real tooth.\n\nThey looked at 20 people who needed this surgery and divided them into two groups, one for each method. After the surgery, they kept track of things like how much plaque was on the implants, whether the gums were bleeding, and how well the gums were doing over the course of six months.\n\nIt turned out that the second group, who waited four months before using their implants like real teeth, had a slightly higher success rate than the first group. But, the difference wasn't big enough to say one method is better than the other.\n\nThe takeaway is that either method can work well and make the fake teeth look good in a person's mouth.",

Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) offers a non-invasive method to modulate this regional activity. We examined whether depressed participants can use rtfMRI-nf to enhance amygdala responses to positive autobiographical memories, and whether this ability alters symptom severity.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS.\nUnmedicated MDD subjects were assigned to receive rtfMRI-nf from either left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) or the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7) and instructed to contemplate happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to raise the level of a bar representing the hemodynamic signal from the target region to a target level. This 40s Happy condition alternated with 40s blocks of rest and counting backwards. A final Transfer run without neurofeedback information was included.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nParticipants in the experimental group upregulated their amygdala responses during positive AM recall. Significant pre-post scan decreases in anxiety ratings and increases in happiness ratings were evident in the experimental versus control group. A whole brain analysis showed that during the transfer run, participants in the experimental group had increased activity compared to the control group in left superior temporal gyrus and temporal polar cortex, and right thalamus.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.\nUsing rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala during recall of positive AMs, depressed subjects were able to self-regulate their amygdala response, resulting in improved mood. Results from this proof-of-concept study suggest that rtfMRI-nf training with positive AM recall holds potential as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of depression.",
        "target": "\nThis study looked at how people with depression can use a special kind of brain training to feel better. The study used a technique called real-time functional MRI neurofeedback, which lets people see how their brain is working and change it if they want to. The researchers asked some people with depression to do brain training exercises where they thought about happy memories, and they found that this helped the people feel less sad and more happy. They also found that the brain training worked by changing the way the happy memories made the person's brain work.\n\nSo, the study found that people with depression can use brain training to change the way their brain works when they think about happy things, which can help them feel better.",

The scientists tested four types of treatment: one with dexamethasone and epinephrine, another with a placebo and epinephrine, one with dexamethasone and salbutamol, and lastly a placebo and salbutamol. \n\nA placebo is something that looks like the real medicine, but isn't, and they use it to compare its effects with the real medicine. Dexamethasone is a medicine that can reduce inflammation and epinephrine and salbutamol help make breathing easier.\n\nThey wanted to see which treatment would help keep babies out of hospital, and also how it improved things like heart rate, breathing rate, and oxygen levels. 162 babies, between one month and one year old, took part in the study. \n\nWhat they found was that regardless of the treatment, babies got better after a four-hour check-up period. But none of the treatments reduced the number of babies that needed to stay at the hospital. They also noticed that heart rate changed significantly in group A where babies were given dexamethasone + epinephrine.\n\nThe conclusion is that using corticosteroids, like dexamethasone, may not be helpful in treating this lung problem in babies.",

Ten patients were randomized into two groups: aquatic physiotherapy with a mean age of 42 years (range: 25\u201367) and conventional physiotherapy with a mean age of 49 years (range: 43\u201359). Both groups were submitted to a twelve-week program of two sessions weekly.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nAfter the intervention, significant improvements were observed regarding the Lequesne index (p-value = 0.0217), Oswestry Disability Index (p-value = 0.0112), range of motion of trunk extension (p-value = 0.0320), trunk flexion muscle strength (p-value = 0.0459), hip extension and abduction muscle strength (p-value = 0.0062 and p-value = 0.0257, respectively). Range of motion of trunk and hip flexion, extension, adduction and abduction, trunk extensor muscle strength and all surface electromyography variables showed no significant statistical difference.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.\nPhysical therapy is efficient to treat musculoskeletal dysfunctions in sickle cell disease patients, irrespective of the technique; however, aquatic therapy showed a trend toward improvement in muscle strength. Further studies with a larger patient sample and longer periods of therapy are necessary to confirm these results.",

Ten patients were randomized into two groups: aquatic physiotherapy with a mean age of 42 years (range: 25\u201367) and conventional physiotherapy with a mean age of 49 years (range: 43\u201359).

This disease can make their hips and lower back hurt a lot. They got permission from ten sick people to see if water exercises or land exercises could help them feel better.\n\nAfter doing these exercises for 12 weeks, both groups showed improvement in how much they could move and how strong they were. The water exercise group seemed to be a tiny bit stronger, but the scientists said they need to study more people for a longer time to really know for certain.",

After randomisation procedure, patients received either normobaric hyperoxia at FiO2 100% over an endotracheal tube for 3 hours (treatment arm) or room air (control arm). Routine cranial CT scans were performed immediately (CT1) and 24 hours (CT2) after completion of surgery and were rated without knowledge of the therapy arm. Two co-primary endpoints were assessed: (i) mean change of pneumocephalus volume, and (ii) air resorption rate in 24 hours. Secondary endpoints were subjective alertness (Stanford Sleepiness Scale) postoperatively and attention (Stroop test), which were evaluated preoperatively and 24 hours after surgery. The mean change in pneumocephalus volume was higher in patients in the treatment arm as compared to patients in the control arm (p = 0.001). The air resorption rate was higher in patients in the treatment arm as compared to patients in the control arm (p = 0.0015). Differences were more pronounced in patients aged 52 years and older.
