        "target": "Doctors are trying to find the best medicine for a type of illness called malaria. So, they did a study where they gave different combinations of medicine to 534 healthy children and observed how well the medicines worked. They also watched for any bad reactions to the medications. They found out that one of the combinations (AS+AQ) seemed to work better than the others. This might be the best option for treating malaria in places like Ghana and West Africa.

        "target": "\nThe study compared three different treatments for malaria in children. The first treatment is called Artesunate+amodiaquine (AS+AQ). The second treatment is called Artemether-lumefantrine (AL). The third treatment is called Artesunate+chlorproguanil-dapsone (AS+CD). The researchers wanted to know which treatment works best to cure malaria.\nThey randomly divided 534 children into three groups and gave them one of the three treatments. They followed the children for 28 days to see if the malaria came back. They found that the children who got the Artesunate+amodiaquine treatment were less likely to have malaria come back compared to the other two groups.\nThe researchers also found that the children in all three groups had a lot of vomiting, which made it hard to compare the results. But overall, the Artesunate+amodiaquine treatment seemed to work best to cure malaria.\nThis study was done in Ghana, but the researchers think it might be useful for other countries in West Africa too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Giovanni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0144skiej\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\n\n\n\nMSG\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMS-\n\n\nMS MS-\nMS-\nMS-\n\n\n\n\nMS-\n\n\nMS-MS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS-\nMS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS-MS-\nMS-\n\n\n\n\nMS-\nMS-\n\n\n\n\nMS-MS-\n\n\n\n\n\nMS-\n\n\nMS-\nMS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS-\n\n\n\n\n\nMS-\n\n\n\n\nMS-MS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MS-\n\n\n MS-\n\n\n\n\n\n MS-MS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS-MS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS- MS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MS-\n\n\n\n\n\nMS-\n\n\n MS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MS- MS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MS-\n\n\n\nMS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS-\n\n\n\nMS-\n\n\n\nMS-\nMS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MS-\n\n\n\n\n\nMS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MS-\n\n\n\n\n\n MS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS-\n\n\nMS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS-\n\n\n\nMS-\n\n\n\n\nMS-\n\n\n\n\n\nMS-\nMS-\n\n\n\n\n\nMS-\n\n\n\n\n\nMS-\n\n\n\n MS-\n\nMS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS-\nMS- MS-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MS- MS-MS-MS-MS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The FTA was found to reduce waiting times and length of stay, as well as lower the rate of patients who leave without being seen (LWBS). There was no significant impact on mortality rates. These results suggest that FTAs can be beneficial for hospitals looking to reduce waiting times and improve the quality of care for non-urgent patients.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt;",

Similarly, mean WTs of CTAS 5 patients decreased by 28 min (95% CI 19 min to 37 min, P &lt; 0.001) post FTA. The mean WTs of urgent patients (CTAS 2/3) were also significantly reduced after the FTA was opened (P &lt; 0.001). The LWBS rate was reduced from 4.7% to 0.7% (95% CI 3.37 to 4.64; P &lt; 0.001). Opening a FTA had no significant impact on mortality rates (P = 0.88).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.\nThe FTA improved ED effectiveness (WTs and LOS) and quality measures (LWBS rates) whereas mortality rate remained unchanged.",
        "target": "This study is about a test done in a hospital in Abu Dhabi to see if having a \"fast track area\" in the emergency room would help make things run more smoothly. The fast track area is supposed to help people with non-emergency issues get treated faster, so the serious cases can get direct attention.\n\nThey tested this out for a year and found that it did make a difference! People with less serious issues had to wait less time and fewer people left without being seen by a doctor. But it didn't make any difference in the number of deaths in the emergency room. So, to keep it simple, the fast track area did help things move faster, but it didn't change how many people lived or died in the hospital.",

They checked the patients' pain levels before the injection and at several weeks after.\n\nAfter the injections, the patients who got morphine or triamcinolone reported less pain compared to the ones who got saline. The pain kept decreasing up till the 12th week. Also, these patients had to take less extra, oral painkillers.

So, either medicine could be used to help people with osteoarthritis knee pain, but morphine might be a better choice because it has fewer side effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSGMTK",

No trial has previously examined whether exercising to neutral or into the hypermobile range affects outcomes. This study aimed to (i) determine if a physiotherapist-prescribed exercise programme focused on knee joint strength and control is effective in reducing knee pain in children with JHS compared to no treatment, and (ii) whether the range in which these exercises are performed affects outcomes.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:\nA prospective, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial conducted in a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia compared an 8 week exercise programme performed into either the full hypermobile range or only to neutral knee extension, following a minimum 2 week baseline period without treatment. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed by sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes. Knee pain was the primary outcome. Quality of life, thigh muscle strength, and function were also measured at (i) initial assessment, (ii) following the baseline period and (iii) post treatment.

Significant improvements in child-reported maximal knee pain were found following treatment, regardless of group allocation with a mean 14.5 mm reduction on the visual analogue scale (95% CI 5.2 \u2013 23.8 mm, p=0.003). Significant differences between treatment groups were noted for parent-reported overall psychosocial health (p=0.009), specifically self-esteem (p=0.034), mental health (p=0.001) and behaviour (p=0.019), in favour of exercising into the hypermobile range (n=11) compared to neutral only (n=14). Conversely, parent-reported overall physical health significantly favoured exercising only to neutral (p=0.037).

        "target": "This study is about children who have a condition that makes their joints extra flexible, which sometimes causes knee pain. The researchers wanted to test if certain exercises would help reduce the pain. The exercises were of two types: one that uses the normal range of knee movement, and other that goes into the extra flexible range. \n\n26 kids aged between 7-16 years old participated in an 8-week exercise program. The researchers found out that both types of exercises helped reduce the knee pain. But interestingly, kids that exercised their knees to the maximum flexibility had improvements in their mental health and behavior, as observed by their parents. On the other hand, parents felt that the physical health of the kids improved more if they kept their exercises to the normal range of knee movement. \n\nNo child had any problem or issue due to the exercises. Thus, the study proved that these exercises prescribed by a therapist, can successfully reduce knee pain in kids with this condition.",

        "target": "This passage talks about a science experiment. There's a kind of medicine called artemisinin that's used to help people with malaria, a really bad sickness. Some people, especially in Tanzania, get this medicine from local drug shops. But the scientists were worried that the shop keepers were not giving the right advice about how to take the medicine, which could possibly make the medicine not work as well. So, they decided to do a test. Some shop keepers were sent text messages reminding them what advice to give. Then, the scientists checked with the people who bought the medicine, and the shop keepers, to see if doing this made any difference. The messages did make shop keepers a little more knowledgeable, but it didn\u2019t really change the way people took their medicine. The scientists think more studies are needed to see if text messages can really help.",

In this cluster randomized trial in drug shops in Tanzania, 42 of 82 selected shops were randomized to receive text message reminders about what advice to provide when dispensing artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Eligible patients purchasing AL at shops in both arms were followed up at home and questioned about each dose taken. Dispensers were interviewed regarding knowledge of AL dispensing practices and receipt of the malaria-related text messages. We interviewed 904 patients and 110 dispensers from 77 shops. Although there was some improvement in dispenser knowledge, there was no difference between arms in adherence measured as completion of all doses (intervention 68.3%, control 69.8%, p [adjusted] = 0.6), or as completion of each dose at the correct time (intervention 33.1%, control 32.6%, p [adjusted] = 0.9). Further studies on the potential of text messages to improve adherence are needed.",
        "target": "\nThis study looked at how well dispensers (people who sell medicine at drug shops) in Tanzania gave advice to patients when they bought medicine to treat malaria. Some dispensers got a special message on their phone that reminded them what advice to give, and some didn't. The study found that the dispensers who got the message didn't do any better at giving good advice than the ones who didn't get the message. The study also found that patients who got the message from the dispensers were just as likely to take their medicine correctly as those who didn't get the message. So, more research is needed to see if text messages can help people take their medicine better.",

        "target": "This passage is talking about a scientific study on pregnant women in the UK. The study looked at how much of a mineral called Selenium (Se), which is found in food, they had in their body. Selenium is important because not having enough of it might make it more likely for pregnant women to get high blood pressure, which can be dangerous during pregnancy. \n\nThe researchers found out that these women had less Selenium in their bodies compared to pregnant women in other countries. Things like their age, education, and social class played a role in how much Selenium they had. Eating Brazil nuts and having more than two servings of seafood per week helped increase Selenium levels in their bodies.\n\nThe most interesting point was that women with higher Selenium in their toenails seemed to have a lower risk of getting high blood pressure during pregnancy. Also, taking Selenium supplements, or extra doses of the mineral, helped reduce this risk even more. \n\nSo, the conclusion of the study was that women in the UK who could get pregnant should try to have more Selenium in their bodies to lessen the risk of getting high blood pressure during pregnancy.",

This study aimed to determine the effects of THC and CBD, both alone and in combination on emotional facial affect recognition. 48 volunteers, selected for high and low frequency of cannabis use and schizotypy, were administered, THC (8 mg), CBD (16 mg), THC+CBD (8 mg+16 mg) and placebo, by inhalation, in a 4-way, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. They completed an emotional facial affect recognition task including fearful, angry, happy, sad, surprise and disgust faces varying in intensity from 20% to 100%. A visual analogue scale (VAS) of feeling 'stoned' was also completed. In comparison to placebo, CBD improved emotional facial affect recognition at 60% emotional intensity; THC was detrimental to the recognition of ambiguous faces of 40% intensity. The combination of THC+CBD produced no impairment. Relative to placebo, both THC alone and combined THC+CBD equally increased feelings of being 'stoned'. CBD did not influence feelings of 'stoned'. No effects of frequency of use or schizotypy were found. In conclusion, CBD improves recognition of emotional facial affect and attenuates the impairment induced by THC. This is the first human study examining the effects of different cannabinoids on emotional processing. It provides preliminary evidence that different pharmacological agents acting upon the endocannabinoid system can both improve and impair recognition of emotional faces.",

Another main constituent of cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD), has seemingly opposite functional effects on the brain. This study aimed to determine the effects of THC and CBD, both alone and in combination on emotional facial affect recognition. 48 volunteers, selected for high and low frequency of cannabis use and schizotypy, were administered, THC (8 mg), CBD (16 mg), THC+CBD (8 mg+16 mg) and placebo, by inhalation, in a 4-way, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. They completed an emotional facial affect recognition task including fearful, angry, happy, sad, surprise and disgust faces varying in intensity from 20% to 100%. A visual analogue scale (VAS) of feeling 'stoned' was also completed. In comparison to placebo, CBD improved emotional facial affect recognition at 60% emotional intensity; THC was detrimental to the recognition of ambiguous faces of 40% intensity. The combination of THC+CBD produced no impairment. Relative to placebo, both THC alone and combined THC+CBD equally increased feelings of being 'stoned'. CBD did not influence feelings of 'stoned'. No effects of frequency of use or schizotypy were found. In conclusion, CBD improves recognition of emotional facial affect and attenuates the impairment induced by THC. This is the first human study examining the effects of different cannabinoids on emotional processing. It provides preliminary evidence that different pharmacological agents acting upon the endocannabinoid system can both improve and impair recognition of emotional faces.",
        "target": "The study is about how the two main parts of cannabis (a plant that is often used as a drug) affect how well we can recognize people's facial expressions. THC is the part of cannabis that makes people feel 'high' and it makes it harder for people to understand facial expressions, especially if they are not very strong or clear. But CBD, another part of cannabis, actually helps us recognize these expressions better, especially if they are somewhat strong. What's interesting is that when THC and CBD are used together, they don't bring any negative effects on understanding faces. The study also found that how often someone uses cannabis or their mental health status doesn't change these results. So, in general, this research found that CBD can help us understand people's feelings better from their faces and also reduces the negative effects of THC. And it's the first study of its kind to look at how these parts of cannabis affect our understanding of emotional faces.",

        "target": "So, there are different things in marijuana that can affect how people feel and think. One of them, called THC, can make it harder to recognize how people are feeling, like if they are happy or sad. Another thing in marijuana, called CBD, can actually help people recognize how people are feeling better. They did some experiments where they gave people different amounts of THC and CBD and asked them to look at pictures of people's faces and try to figure out how they were feeling. They found out that CBD helps people recognize how people are feeling better, but THC makes it harder. It's like CBD is a superhero for recognizing emotions, and THC is like a bad guy that tries to make it harder.",

The scientists wanted to see if a supplement called astaxanthin (Asx for short) could help control these negative effects. \n\nThey had 40 trained soccer players take this supplement or a placebo (a pill that doesn't do anything) and kept track of a lot of different measurements from their saliva and blood. After 90 days, they found that the players taking Asx had more of a certain helpful thing in their saliva, less stress on their body as shown in their blood, and less signs of muscle damage. They also didn't have as many signs of inflammation in their body as the players taking the placebo. \n\nThis makes the scientists think that Asx might be really good at keeping your body from getting too overly stressed and inflamed from rigorous exercise.

The first group (Group A) signed the hospital's standard Consent for Operation form only while the second group (Group B) signed a separate Consent for Anesthesia form additionally. Patients were interviewed postoperatively with an eight-item questionnaire with responses in a 5-point Likert scale. A composite adequacy of consent index was generated from the responses and analyzed.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:.\nTwo hundred patients (100 in each group) were studied. All patients indicated that the anesthesiologist(s) had their permission to proceed with their anesthesia care. The mean adequacy of consent index score in Group B was higher than that of Group A (30.6 \u00b1 4.6 [standard deviation (SD)] vs. 27.9 \u00b1 5.2 [SD]) (P &lt; 0.001). The separate written consent had a positive impact on the patients' understanding of the nature and purpose of the intended anesthesia procedures (P = 0.04), satisfaction with the adequacy of information provided about common side effects (P &lt; 0.001) and rare but serious complications (P = 0.008).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.\nA separate written consent for anesthesia improved the efficacy of the informed consent process with respect to better information about the nature and purpose of anesthesia, common side effects, and rare but serious complications.",
        "target": "This study was trying to see if adding an extra permission form for the part of surgery where they make you sleep (called anesthesia) helped adults understand what was going to happen during their operation better. They had two groups of people - one only signed the usual form before surgery, and the other group signed the usual form and an extra one for the sleep portion specifically.\n\nAfter the surgeries, they asked a few questions to see how well both groups understood details about the surgery and how satisfied they were with the information they were given. They found that the group who signed the extra form understood better about what would happen during the anesthesia, what common side effects might be, and what serious but rare complications could occur. So, it seemed that the extra form served its purpose.  \n\nIn simpler words, they found out that giving you a second form to sign specifically about the part where they make you unconscious helps you understand what's going on better and makes you feel better informed.",
