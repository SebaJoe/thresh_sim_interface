        "target": "This passage is about a study on how well two medicines work together to relieve pain and swelling after a type of dental surgery. The surgery is for removing the third molars, which are also known as wisdom teeth. The medicines they studied are called dexamethasone, a type of steroid, and diclofenac K, a regular painkiller. The researchers wanted to know if giving these medicines together worked better than just giving diclofenac K alone.\n\nThe study took place at a hospital in Lagos, Nigeria, and it included 100 patients. The patients were divided into two groups: one that received both medicines and another that only got diclofenac K. To check how well the medicines were working, they measured patients' pain levels, the swelling in their faces, and how much they could open their mouths (this is the trismus mentioned in the text).\n\nThe results showed that patients who got both medicines had less pain and swelling than those who only got diclofenac K. However, there was no difference between the two groups in how wide they could open their mouths. In summary, the combination of medicines worked better than just one in decreasing pain and swelling after wisdom tooth surgery.",

        "target": "Scientists in Afghanistan tried to figure out how well two different medicines worked to fight off a common type of malaria, a type of illness caused by tiny parasites, using a special experiment called a randomized controlled trial. They discovered that both medicines worked pretty well, but one, called dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, worked a little better and faster in getting rid of the parasites. The medicine also helped to keep the parasites from coming back. They noted that the most effective method was to have healthy levels of hemoglobin, a stuff in our blood, to start with. None of the people who took the medicines got really sick from them. They then logged their trial on a special government website for scientists to share their tests.",

Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) delivered to these patients by nurses in primary care might be efficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PST by mental health nurses compared with usual care (UC) by the general practitioner for primary care patients with mental health problems.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS.\nAn economic evaluation from a societal perspective was performed alongside a randomized clinical trial. Patients with a positive General Health Questionnaire score (score \u2265 4) and who visited their general practitioner at least three times during the past 6 months were eligible.

They measured how the patients improved and also how much each treatment cost.\n\nThey found that both treatments worked about the same, but the cost was a bit lower for PST. So, they concluded that Problem-Solving Treatment might be a more cost-effective way to treat mental health issues than the usual methods.

        "source": "ABSTRACT.PURPOSE:\nWe evaluated the efficacy of alfuzosin for the treatment of ureteral calculi less than 10 mm in diameter after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL).\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:\nA randomized, single-blind clinical trial was performed prospectively by one physician between June 2010 and August 2011. A total of 84 patients with ureteral calculi 5 to 10 mm in diameter were divided into two groups. Alfuzosin 10 mg (once daily) and loxoprofen sodium 68.1 mg (as needed) were prescribed to group 1 (n=41), and loxoprofen sodium 68.1 mg (as needed) only was prescribed to group 2 (n=44). The drug administration began immediately after ESWL and continued until stone expulsion was confirmed up to a maximum of 42 days after the procedure.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:\nThirty-nine of 41 (95.1%) patients in group 1 and 40 of 43 (93.0%) patients in group 2 ultimately passed stones (p=0.96). The number of ESWL sessions was 1.34\u00b10.65 and 1.41\u00b10.85 in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.33). The patients who required analgesics after ESWL were 8 (19.5%) in group 1 and 13 (30.2%) in group 2 (p=0.31). Visual analogue scale pain severity scores were 5.33\u00b11.22 and 6.43\u00b11.36 in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.056). The time to stone expulsion in groups 1 and 2 was 9.5\u00b14.8 days and 14.7\u00b19.8 days, respectively (p=0.005). No significant adverse effects occurred.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:\nThe use of alfuzosin in combination with ESWL seems to facilitate stone passage and to reduce the time of stone expulsion but does not affect the stone-free rate.",
        "target": "\nThis means that a medicine called alfuzosin, when used with a special kind of shock figurine called ESWL, can help stones move out of the urinary tract more quickly.

This is a condition where nerves in the hands and feet are damaged, causing numbness, pain, and weakness. \n\nThey found that both ways of treating diabetes were equal in terms of how likely people were to develop DPN.

        "target": "\n\"Scientists found that people with a certain gene near the IRS1 gene were more likely to have their metabolic syndrome (a group of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes) improve when they ate a high-fat diet compared to a low-fat diet. They looked at 738 people who were overweight or obese and had this gene and found that those with the A-allele of the rs1522813 variant near IRS1 were more likely to have their metabolic syndrome improve when they ate a high-fat diet. They did this for 2 years and found that the A-allele carriers had a higher rate of improvement in their metabolic syndrome when they ate a high-fat diet compared to a low-fat diet.\"\n\nCan you please explain why the author used the term \"ABSTRACT\" in the passage?\n\n",

        "target": "This experiment is about a disease called diabetes that can make bones weaker, even though the amount of minerals in these bones may still be normal or high. The scientists were studying a medicine called raloxifene that helps improve the quality of bones. They checked to see if this medicine could help prevent the harmful effects of diabetes on the weakness of bones in rats that were very likely to get diabetes. \n\nThe scientists fed these rats a diet that would make them more likely to get diabetes and gave some of them raloxifene while others didn't get any. They did this for 12 weeks and kept a very close eye on the rats' blood sugar levels. \n\nWhat they found was that the rats treated with raloxifene were less likely to get diabetes and had better blood sugar levels than the rats that didn't get the medicine. Even more, the bones of the rats that got raloxifene were stronger than the bones of the rats that did not get the medicine because they could absorb more energy before breaking.\n\nSo this study shows that raloxifene might be a really good medicine to make bones stronger in individuals with diabetes and it might even help to prevent diabetes. This can be very important but it's not for sure until bigger studies are done in the future.",

        "target": "This passage is explaining a scientific study done in Germany. The study wanted to see if empowering or encouraging cancer patients in their 60s and above by giving them an information booklet and having them keep a diary would help them heal better or feel better after their cancer surgery. This idea was tested on a group of 652 patients in two major hospitals.\n\nHow was this done? The patients were divided into 2 groups. One group got the regular hospital care while the other group got the regular care plus they were given a handbook and asked to keep a diary. The researchers then checked to see how long the patients stayed in the hospital after their surgery and also how they were feeling health-wise a year after their surgery.\n\nThe results? It wasn't found that the people who were given the booklet and kept a diary left the hospital earlier or were healthier a year after their surgery. However, it was found that they experienced less pain after their surgery. The study also found out that the time patients stayed in the hospital after surgery was influenced by things like their nutritional state before surgery, how severe their surgery was, and how long they were under anesthesia. \n\nSo overall, while keeping the diary and the booklet didn't necessarily make patients healthier, it did seem to help them experience less pain after surgery.",

The study included patients aged 65 years and older undergoing elective surgery for gastro-intestinal, genitourinary, and thoracic cancer. The patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group, i.e. patient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping, or to the control group, which received standard care. Randomization was done by block randomization in blocks of four in order of enrollment. The primary outcome were 1,postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS) and 2. long-term global health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year postoperatively. HRQoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. Secondary outcomes encompassed postoperative stress and complications. Further objectives were the identification of predictors of LOS, and HRQoL at 12 months.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nOverall 652 patients were included. The mean age was 72 \u00b1 4.9 years, and the majority of patients were male (68.6%, n = 447). The ^median of postoperative length of stay was 9 days (IQR 7\u201314 day). There were no significant differences between the intervention and the control groups in postoperative LOS (p = 0.99) or global HRQoL after one year (women: p = 0.54, men: p = 0.94). While overall complications and major complications occurred in 74% and 24% of the cases, respectively, frequency and severity of complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients in the intervention group reported significantly less postoperative pain (p = 0.03) than the control group. Independent predictors for LOS were identified as severity of surgery, length of anesthesia, major postoperative complications, nutritional state, and pre-operative physical functional capacity measured by the Timed Up and Go-test by multiple robust regressions.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.\nPatient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping did not shorten the postoperative LOS in elderly onco-surgical patients, but improved quality of care regarding postoperative pain. Postoperative length of stay is influenced by pre-operative nutritional state, pre-operative functional impairment, severity of surgery, and length of anesthesia.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicaltrials.gov.

        "target": "\nThis study looked at how giving patients information and a diary to keep track of their health can affect their recovery after surgery. Researchers wanted to know if this would shorten the time they spent in the hospital after surgery, but it didn't. However, patients who got the information and diary reported less pain after surgery. The study also found that other things, like how sick the patient was before surgery, how long they were under anesthesia, and how well they could do things like stand up and walk, could also affect how long they stayed in the hospital.\n\n\n\n\n",
