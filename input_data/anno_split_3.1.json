The researchers wanted to see if this medicine could help people who didn't get it right after their surgery. They looked at patients who had surgery 2 years ago and weren't showing signs of more cancer. Some of these people were then given TAM, while others weren't.\n\nThe researchers were watching for any signs of cancer returning or new cancer appearing. They found that the people who took the TAM medicine had fewer cases of a certain type of breast cancer coming back than those who didn't take the medicine. But other than that, the two groups - the ones who took the medicine and the one who didn't - didn't seem to have different outcomes.\n\nSo in simple terms, this study is saying that for this specific group of people, taking TAM seemed to help a bit with preventing a certain type of breast cancer from returning, but otherwise didn't change much.",

In each patient one ovary was randomly allocated to retrieval with either a 20 G/ 35 mm (thin) or 17 G/ 35 mm (standard) needle, the other ovary was then retrieved with the opposite needle.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nThe standard diameter needle was used to collect a total of 215 oocytes from 355 aspirated follicles (60.6%) compared to 203 oocytes from 352 aspirated follicles (57.7%) with the thinner needle (p = 0.23). Stratifying outcomes by anti-Mu\u0308llerian hormone (AMH), as indicator of ovarian reserve, and by body mass index (BMI) the oocyte yields, still, did not differ (AMH, r (17) = \u22120.20, p = 0.44; BMI, r (17) =0.02, p = 0.96). Outcomes also did not vary among women with diminished ovarian reserve (p = 0.17) and in women with normal ovarian reserve (p = 1.00). Operating time was, however, significantly increased by 3.3 minutes per ovary (z = \u22123.08, p = 0.002) with the thinner needle.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.\nNeedle diameter does not affect oocyte yield, including in obese patients and patients with diminished ovarian reserve. Thinner needles appear to significantly prolong operating time.",
        "target": "\nThis study wanted to know if using smaller needles to collect eggs during in vitro fertilization (IVF) makes a difference in how many eggs are collected compared to using larger needles. They looked at 21 women and used one ovary with a smaller needle and the other ovary with a larger needle. They found that the number of eggs collected didn't change whether they used a smaller or larger needle. They also looked at how well the women's ovaries worked and found that the number of eggs collected didn't change based on how well the ovaries worked. They did find that using the smaller needle took a little longer to collect the eggs.",

        "target": "The scientists were checking out what happens when you freeze cow egg cells (oocytes) and thaw them out again. This is called \"vitrification\" - sort of like turning them into glass, to keep them safe. For this, they used special solutions (like magic formulas) with ingredients like ethylene glycol, which is used in antifreeze, and sucrose, which is a type of sugar. \n\nThey divided the eggs into four groups. The first group was a control group, which got no treatment at all - the eggs were just left to do their thing. The other three groups got different combinations of the special solutions. After that, all the cells were let to mature and fertilize and grow, right in a lab dish.\n\nThe control group and the ones that only got the special solutions did okay. But the eggs that got frozen (vitrified group) and then later warmed up again didn't do so well - fewer of them managed to split and grow into embryos. \n\nSo, their conclusion was that the freezing and warming process might have a negative effect on cow egg cells and their ability to grow into embryos.",

Outcome measures included patient self-ratings on the Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ), a validated, nOH-specific tool that assesses symptom severity and symptom impact on daily activities.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:.\nFrom randomization to endpoint (n = 162), improvement in mean OHQ composite score favored droxidopa over placebo by 0.90 units (p = 0.003). Improvement in OHQ symptom subscore favored droxidopa by 0.73 units (p = 0.010), with maximum change in \"dizziness/lightheadedness.\" Improvement in symptom-impact subscore favored droxidopa by 1.06 units (p = 0.003), with maximum change for \"standing a long time.\" Mean standing systolic blood pressure (BP) increased by 11.2 vs 3.9 mm Hg (p &lt; 0.001), and mean supine systolic BP by 7.6 vs 0.8 mm Hg (p &lt; 0.001). At endpoint, supine systolic BP &gt;180 mm Hg was observed in 4.9% of droxidopa and 2.5% of placebo recipients.

Outcome measures included patient self-ratings on the Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ), a validated, nOH-specific tool that assesses symptom severity and symptom impact on daily activities.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:.\nFrom randomization to endpoint (n = 162), improvement in mean OHQ composite score favored droxidopa over placebo by 0.90 units (p = 0.003). Improvement in OHQ symptom subscore favored droxidopa by 0.73 units (p = 0.010), with maximum change in \"dizziness/lightheadedness.\" Improvement in symptom-impact subscore favored droxidopa by 1.06 units (p = 0.003), with maximum change for \"standing a long time.\" Mean standing systolic blood pressure (BP) increased by 11.2 vs 3.9 mm Hg (p &lt; 0.001), and mean supine systolic BP by 7.6 vs 0.8 mm Hg (p &lt; 0.001).

        "target": "This passage talks about an experiment done with a medicine called droxidopa. This medicine is tested on people who feel dizzy or faint when they stand up because of certain illnesses. The test found out that this medicine helps reduce these symptoms and helps these people perform their daily activities better. It also improves their blood pressure readings when they stand up. Some people experienced minor side effects but overall, the medicine was safe to use. So, the study concludes that this medicine is helpful for people with these symptoms.",

We designed this study to investigate the clinical effects and complications of different loading doses, 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcg/kg.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS.\nForty six patients, of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II, who required elective and emergency operation under spinal anesthesia were randomly assigned to group L or group H. Group L received a loading dose of 0.5 \u03bcg/kg for 10 minutes while group H received 1.0 \u03bcg/kg. Bispectral index (BIS), systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and Ramsay score were recorded at T0 (before loading), TL (just after loading) and T10, 20, 30 (10, 20, 30 minutes after TL). Complications, drug use, lowest BIS and time to reach BIS 80 after termination of dexmedetomidine were recorded during this study.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nIn group H, BIS value decreased significantly after TL compared to the baseline (T0), while in group L after T10. Between two groups, BIS values showed a significant differences only at T10, BIS of group H was lower than that of group L. Ramsay score showed no significant differences except in TL; the score of group L was significantly lower than that of group H. Other vital signs and complications showed a minimal differences between two groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.\nHigher loading dose (1.0 \u03bcg/kg) of dexmedetomidine can lead to faster sedation without any severe complications.",
        "target": "\nThe study looked at how two different doses of a drug called dexmedetomidine affected people who were having surgery under local anesthesia. One group got a dose of 0.5 micrograms per kilogram of body weight for 10 minutes, and the other group got a dose of 1.0 micrograms per kilogram for the same amount of time. The researchers found that the higher dose made the patients feel more relaxed and sleepy faster, but there were no major side

        "target": "We did a study to find out if a special surgery helps with pain in the lower back that comes from a joint near your hip called the SI joint. This joint can hurt a lot in some people and regular treatment doesn't always help. So, we compared two groups: one where people got the surgery and another where people didn't get the surgery. The surgery we used was a small one, where little pieces of metal, shaped like triangles, were put into the joint. \n\nWe found out that the surgery works really well - much better than not having surgery. After six months, 8 out of 10 people felt a lot better, compared to only about 2 out of 10 people who didn't have surgery. People who had the surgery were also more active and happier. \n\nThere were a few more problems with the surgery group, like a higher chance of hurting or needing more surgery, but these were not common and did not affect the overall results. \n\nFinally, it means that the special surgery is a good choice for people who have tried regular treatments for their painful SI joint, but are still in pain.",

SI joint fusion can relieve pain and improve quality of life in patients who have failed nonoperative care. To date, no study has concurrently compared surgical and non-surgical treatments for chronic SI joint dysfunction.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:\nWe conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of 148 subjects with SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or sacroiliac joint disruptions who were assigned to either minimally invasive SI joint fusion with triangular titanium implants (N=102) or non-surgical management (NSM, n=46). SI joint pain scores, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) were collected at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment commencement. Six-month success rates, defined as the proportion of treated subjects with a 20-mm improvement in SI joint pain in the absence of severe device-related or neurologic SI joint-related adverse events or surgical revision, were compared using Bayesian methods.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:\nSubjects (mean age 51, 70% women) were highly debilitated at baseline (mean SI joint VAS pain score 82, mean ODI score 62). Six-month follow-up was obtained in 97.3%. By 6 months, success rates were 81.4% in the surgical group vs. 23.9% in the NSM group (difference of 56.6%, 95% posterior credible interval 41.4-70.0%, posterior probability of superiority &gt;0.999). Clinically important (\u226515 point) ODI improvement at 6 months occurred in 75% of surgery subjects vs. 27.3% of NSM subjects.

Because of a high predictive value of rapid virological response (RVR) for sustained virological response (SVR), we conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial to compare 24- and 48-week peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy for patients with HCV genotype 6 in Southern China who achieved an RVR.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS.\nTreatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 were treated with pegylated interferon \u03b1-2a (180 \u03bcg/week) and ribavirin (800\u20131,200 mg, according to weight) for 4 weeks. Patients who achieved an RVR, which was defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 (&lt;50 IU), were randomized to receive either an additional 20 or 44 weeks of treatment (24- and 48-week treatment groups, respectively).

        "target": "This study evaluated the effectiveness of two different treatment regimens for hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 in Southern China. The study included 152 patients who had an RVR (rapid virological response) and were randomly assigned to either a 24-week or 48-week treatment regimen. The primary outcome measure was sustained virological response (SVR), which was defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 (&lt;50 IU). The results of the study showed that both treatment regimens were effective, with an SVR rate of 90.8% (69/76) for the 24-week regimen and 88.2% (67/76) for the 48-week regimen. There were no significant differences in terms of adverse events between the two regimens. In conclusion, the study showed that 24 weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy was non-inferior to 48 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 6a in Southern China who achieved an RVR.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt;",

Patients from 3 centers (Maastricht, Zwickau, Adelaide) with end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee were randomized to either an MIS group with dedicated instrumentation or a conventional group to receive cruciate retaining CAS-TKA without patella resurfacing. The primary outcome was to compare post operative pain and range of motion (ROM). The secondary outcome was to measure the duration of surgery, blood loss, chair rise test, quadriceps strength, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS),WOMAC scores, mechanical leg axis and component alignment.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nPatients in the MIS group (3.97 \u00b1 2.16) had significant more pain at 2 weeks than patients in the conventional group (2.77 \u00b1 1.43) p = 0.003. There was no significant difference in any of the other primary outcome parameters. Surgery time was significantly longer (p &lt; 0.001) and there were significantly higher blood loss (p = 0.002) in the MIS group as compared to the conventional group. The difference of the mean mechanical leg alignment between the groups was not statistically significant (\u20130.43\u00b0 (95 % CI \u20131.50 \u2013 0.64); p = 0.43).  There was no significant difference of component alignment between the two surgical groups with respect to flexion/extension (p = 0.269), varus/valgus (p = 0.653) or rotational alignment (p = 0.485) of the femur component and varus valgus alignment (p = 0.778) or posterior slope (p = 0.164) of the tibial component.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.\nThere was no advantage of the MIS approach compared to a conventional approach CAS-TKA in any of the primary outcome measurements assessed, however the MIS approach was associated with longer surgical time and greater blood loss. MIS-TKA in combination with computer navigation is safe in terms of implant positioning.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT02625311 8 December 2015",
        "target": "\nThe study compared two different ways of doing knee surgery. One way is called minimally invasive surgery (MIS). The other way is called computer-assisted surgery (CAS). The study found that there was no difference in how well the knee healed or how much pain the patients had after the surgery between the two groups. However, the group that had MIS surgery took longer to do and had more bleeding during the surgery. The study also found that the way the implant was placed in the knee did not differ between the two groups.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "target": "Sure, this may be a better explanation for a fifth grader: \n\nThis research was about a common kidney operation where they sometimes use something called a 'stent' - it's like a small tube to make sure everything runs smoothly. However, this stent sometimes can get something like 'crust' on it which can make it difficult to remove later and it can even cause other problems. \n\nSo, the researchers were trying to find a better way to use the stent that would cause fewer problems for the patient. They divided people that were going to get this operation into two groups. One group got the operation in the regular, old way. The other group got the operation in a new way where they attached the stent to another tube called a 'Foley catheter'.\n\nWhat they found was that the people who had the stent attached to the Foley catheter had less 'crust' on their stent and also less infection. There was also less of a scary thing called 'urinary leakage' in the group with the new operation method.\n\nSo, even though the differences between the two groups weren't super big, it still seems like the new way of doing the operation could be better because it caused fewer problems.",
