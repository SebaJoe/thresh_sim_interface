Maximal mean LDL\u2010C reductions from day \u22121 baseline (prealirocumab) occurred on day 71 in all groups: alirocumab plus placebo, 47.4%; alirocumab plus ezetimibe, 56.6%; and alirocumab plus fenofibrate, 54.3%.

        "target": "This passage talks about a heart medicine called alirocumab. It's like a sponge that soaks up a bad protein (PCSK9) in your body that can make your heart sick. Usually, people use this medicine with another type of medicine called statins, but scientists aren't sure how it works with other types of heart medicine.\n\nSo, they did a test where they gave people different types of heart medicines, along with alirocumab, and then checked their blood to see how much bad protein was left. They found that all the medicines helped to reduce the bad protein, but when used with some other heart medicines (ezetimibe, fenofibrate), it seemed like alirocumab wasn't lasting as long in the body as it should. However, it still worked well and could still be used every 4 weeks, even with those other medicines.\n\nThis means, if you have a bad heart protein and need medication, you could potentially use alirocumab with different types of heart medicines, not just statins.",

They found that the students in the program did a little bit better in one area, which is called Motor Skills. This means they were a little bit better at things like catching a ball or jumping.

The primary aim of the current study was to evaluate whether the use of a patient navigator altered adherence to follow-up eye care appointments in community-versus office-based settings.\n\nABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS.\nPatients diagnosed with a glaucoma-related condition following a comprehensive eye examination at 43 community sites in Philadelphia, PA, USA, were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Patients were randomized into three groups for a 1-year period: Group 1 (G1) received follow-up eye care in a community-based setting with assistance from a patient navigator; Group 2 (G2) received follow-up eye care in an office-based setting with assistance from a patient navigator; and Group 3 (G3) received follow-up eye care in an office-based setting without a patient navigator (usual care). Adherence rates were compared among these three groups using a chi-squared test at a significance level of 0.05.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nA total of 155 patients with glaucoma-related diagnoses were enrolled. The mean age (\u00b1standard deviation) was 71.2 (\u00b110.0) years. Patients were predominantly female (65.8%, n=102/155) and African-American (71.6%, n=111/155).

However, it can sometimes affect people's blood pressure, which can be a problem when they're getting an anesthesia in their spine for surgery. \n\nIn this experiment, they divided patients into two groups. One group got the medicine before the anesthesia was given, and the other group got the medicine after the anesthesia. They were trying to see which timing was better and made people feel less scared and more comfortable.\n\nThey found out that patients who got the medicine after the anesthesia had less problems with low blood pressure. But, when it came to patient's anxiety and comfort, there was no difference whether they got the medicine before or after anesthesia. \n\nSo, they concluded that giving the medicine after spinal anesthesia seems to be better because it causes fewer problems with blood pressure and it doesn't make a difference in how scared or comfortable patients felt.

Dexmedetomidine can cause a biphasic cardiovascular response, and induce transient hypertension. Hypotension is a common complication of spinal anesthesia. Decreasing anxiety of patients before procedure is important for high quality of procedure. This study aimed to compare the incidence of hypotension and patients' anxiety and comfort levels when dexmedetomidine was intravenously administered before and after spinal anesthesia.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS.\nSeventy-four patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification I or II were randomly allocated into two groups. Spinal anesthesia was performed using 12 mg of 0.5% heavy bupivacaine. In Group A, 1 \u03bcg/kg of dexmedetomidine was intravenously administered for 10 min, followed by the maintenance infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/hr after 5 min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection. Patients in Group B received same dose of dexmedetomidine by intravenous administration before 5 min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection. Perioperative vital signs, anxiety (using the Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and comfort (using the numerical rating scale) were evaluated.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nThe incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in Group A (16.1%) than in Group B (48.4%) during infusion of dexmedetomidine (p = 0.01). The need for treatment of hypotension is higher in Group B than Group A (p = 0.02). The incidence of bradycardia and desaturation did not significantly differ between the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences regarding the patients' anxiety and comfort.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.\nHypotension is more frequently occurred, and the treatment of hypotension is more needed in Group B. The intravenously administration of dexmedetomidine before spinal anesthesia has no advantages in hemodynamic status and patients' comfort compared to that after spinal anesthesia during lower limb surgery.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02155010. Retrospectively registered on May 22, 2014.",
        "target": "\nThis study looked at how two different ways of giving a medicine called dexmedetomidine before a spinal anesthesia (anesthesia for surgery) affected the patient's blood pressure and how they felt during and after the surgery. They found that one way of giving the medicine made the patient's blood pressure drop less often, but the other way did not make a difference in how the patient felt.\nSo, the doctors learned that giving the medicine in one way before the spinal anesthesia is betterymanaging the patient's blood pressure during the surgery. But, it did not make a difference in how the patient felt overall.",

        "target": "This medical study is about a drug called olaparib which is used to treat serious ovarian cancer. This cancer is often treated with a strong medicine called platinum, and olaparib is used to help people who have had good results with platinum treatment but their cancer has come back. \n\nIn this study, scientists gave this drug to a bunch of women, alongside a placebo (which is a fake drug that doesn't do anything), to see what would happen. They wanted to know if olaparib would make people's life better or worse while they're taking it. They used a survey called FACT-O to keep track of how patients' lives were being affected. \n\nMost of the women, whether they got the real medicine or the dummy one, said they didn't notice any change in their quality of life. The scientists' fancy calculations proved that there wasn't a significant difference between the women who took olaparib and those who didn't, in terms of their quality of life.\n\nSo, they concluded that the medicine was well-tolerated, meaning it didn't make life worse for the patients. They also said the results might be different for patients who didn't have a good response to the platinum treatment before. Therefore, further investigations are needed, but for these specific patients, olaparib seemed to be a good choice without making their life worse.",

Systolic BP, diastolic BP, heart rate, LUTS, and QoL satisfaction with urinary symptoms were similar in the three groups. Significant differences in pain magnitude and urinary residual sense of indwelling catheters were observed among the three groups, with inhalation of linalyl acetate being significantly more effective than inhalation of lavender or vehicle. Inhalation of linalyl acetate is an effective nursing intervention to relieve pain and urinary residual sense of indwelling urinary catheters following their removal from patients who underwent CRC surgery.",
        "target": "This passage is about a study where doctors were trying to see if sniffing certain smells could help reduce pain and make you feel better after surgery for colorectal cancer - this type of cancer happens in your tummy area. They had people smell lavender oil, something called linalyl acetate, or just a plain smell (which was a control group) for 20 minutes, and then they checked their heart rate, blood pressure, and asked them about their pain and how they were feeling. They found out that the people who sniffed the linalyl acetate smell felt less pain and discomfort after having their pee tubes removed than the other groups. This means that smelling linalyl acetate might be a good thing for nurses to do to help people feel better after surgery.",

The researchers wanted to know if one of these smells was better than the other at helping with these problems. They looked at 66 people who had surgery for colon cancer and had a tube in their bladder to collect urine during their recovery. The people inhaled one of these two smells or a fake smell (called the \"vehicle\" group) for 20 minutes. The researchers measured how much pain the people were in, their blood pressure, their heart rate, and how well their urinary system was working before and after inhaling the smell. They found that the smell called linalyl acetate was better at relieving pain and urinary problems than the other two smells. This means that nurses can use linalyl acetate to help patients feel better after colon cancer surgery.",

While the benefits of paravertebral block (PVB) on pain after thoracotomy and mastectomy have been demonstrated, not enough investigations on the effects of PVB on pain after open cholecystectomy have been conducted. We tested the hypothesis that a single-injection thoracic PVB reduces pain scores, decreases opioid consumption, and prolongs analgesic request time after cholecystectomy.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS.\nOf 52 patients recruited, 50 completed the study. They were randomly allocated into two groups: the paravertebral group and the control group. The outcome measures were the severity of pain measured on numeric pain rating scale, total opioid consumption, and first analgesic request time during the first postoperative 24 hours.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULT.\nThe main outcomes recorded during 24 hours after surgery were Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores (NRS, 0\u201310), cumulative opioid consumption, and the first analgesic request time. Twenty four hours after surgery, NRS at rest was 4 (3\u20136) vs 5 (5\u20137) and at movement 4 (4\u20137) vs 6 (5\u20137.5) for the PVB and control groups, respectively. The difference between the groups over the whole observation period was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). Twenty-four hours after surgery, median (25th\u201375th percentile) cumulative morphine consumption was 0 (0\u20132) vs 2.5 (2\u20134) mg (P&lt;0.0001) and cumulative tramadol consumption was 200 (150\u2013250) mg vs 300 (200\u2013350) mg in the paravertebral and in the control group, respectively (P=0.003). After surgery, the median (25th\u201375th percentile) first analgesic requirement time was prolonged in the PVB group in statistically significant fashion (P&lt;0.0001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS.\nSingle-shot thoracic PVB as a component of multi-modal analgesic regimen provided superior analgesia when compared with the control group up to 24 postoperative hours after cholecystectomy, and we recommend this block for post cholecystectomy pain relief.",

They wanted to see if using a certain type of pain block, called a paravertebral block (PVB), would help reduce pain, decrease the amount of painkillers required and prolong the time before the first request for pain relief.\n\nThey tested this on 50 patients who had this surgery. Half got the PVB and half didn't (the control group). They measured how bad the pain was, the total amount of painkillers consumed, and the time before the first request for more pain relief in the first day after the surgery.\n\nThe results showed that the group who got the PVB felt less pain, needed fewer painkillers and asked for relief later than the group who didn't. This tells us that this type of pain block was better at reducing pain and the need for painkillers after gallbladder surgery.\n\nSo, they suggest that using this type of pain relief should be considered for managing pain after gallbladder surgery.",

        "target": "\nThis is a study about a medicine called riociguat. It helps people with a bad heart. The medicine makes the heart work better and reduces the pressure in the heart. The study looked at how well the medicine worked in people with bad hearts that can't be fixed with surgery or those who have had surgery but still have problems. The study found that the medicine helped these people by making their heart work better and reducing the pressure in their heart. It also helped them walk further without getting tired.\nI hope this helps!",

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total score changes from baseline (primary endpoint) at week 8 (flexible-dose study) or week 6 (forced-dose study) were assessed with mixed-effects models for repeated measures. Secondary endpoints included improvement on the dichotomized Clinical Global Impressions\u2013Improvement scale (CGI-I; key secondary endpoint) and changes from baseline on the ADHD-RS-IV subscales. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and vital signs.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nLeast squares (LS) mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) ADHD-RS-IV total score changes from baseline to end of treatment were \u221217.0 \u00b1 1.03 with placebo, \u221225.4 \u00b1 0.74 with LDX, and \u221222.1 \u00b1 0.73 with OROS-MPH in the forced-dose study and \u221213.4 \u00b1 1.19 with placebo, \u221225.6 \u00b1 0.82 with LDX, and \u221223.5 \u00b1 0.80 with OROS-MPH in the flexible-dose study. LS mean \u00b1 SEM treatment difference for the change from baseline significantly favored LDX over OROS-MPH in the forced-dose [\u22123.4 \u00b1 1.04, p = 0.0013, effect size (ES) \u22120.33] but not the flexible-dose (\u22122.1 \u00b1 1.15, p = 0.0717, ES \u22120.20) study. The percentage of improved participants on the dichotomized CGI-I at end of treatment was significantly greater with LDX than with OROS-MPH in the forced-dose study (81.4 vs. 71.3%, p = 0.0188) but not the flexible-dose study (LDX 83.1%, OROS-MPH 81.0%, p = 0.6165). The LS mean \u00b1 SEM treatment differences for change from baseline on the ADHD-RS-IV hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattentiveness subscales nominally favored LDX in the forced-dose study (hyperactivity/impulsivity subscale \u22121.3 \u00b1 0.49, nominal p = 0.0081, ES \u22120.27; inattentiveness subscale \u22122.0 \u00b1 0.63, nominal p = 0.0013, ES \u22120.33), but there were no significant differences between active treatments in the flexible-dose study. In both studies, LDX and OROS-MPH were superior to placebo for all efficacy-related endpoints (all nominal p &lt; 0.0001; ES range \u22120.43 to \u22121.16). The overall frequency of TEAEs for LDX and OROS-MPH, respectively, were 66.5 and 58.9% in the forced-dose study and 83.2 and 82.1% in the flexible-dose study. TEAEs occurring in \u2265 5% of participants that were also reported at two or more times the rate of placebo were decreased appetite, decreased weight, insomnia, initial insomnia, dry mouth, and nasopharyngitis (LDX and OROS-MPH), irritability and dizziness (LDX only), and increased heart rate (OROS-MPH only) in the forced-dose study and decreased appetite, decreased weight, insomnia, and dizziness (LDX and OROS-MPH) and dry mouth and upper abdominal pain (LDX only) in the flexible-dose study.

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total score changes from baseline (primary endpoint) at week 8 (flexible-dose study) or week 6 (forced-dose study) were assessed with mixed-effects models for repeated measures. Secondary endpoints included improvement on the dichotomized Clinical Global Impressions\u2013Improvement scale (CGI-I; key secondary endpoint) and changes from baseline on the ADHD-RS-IV subscales. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and vital signs.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nLeast squares (LS) mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) ADHD-RS-IV total score changes from baseline to end of treatment were \u221217.0 \u00b1 1.03 with placebo, \u221225.4 \u00b1 0.74 with LDX, and \u221222.1 \u00b1 0.73 with OROS-MPH in the forced-dose study and \u221213.4 \u00b1 1.19 with placebo, \u221225.6 \u00b1 0.82 with LDX, and \u221223.5 \u00b1 0.80 with OROS-MPH in the flexible-dose study. LS mean \u00b1 SEM treatment difference for the change from baseline significantly favored LDX over OROS-MPH in the forced-dose [\u22123.4 \u00b1 1.04, p = 0.0013, effect size (ES) \u22120.33] but not the flexible-dose (\u22122.1 \u00b1 1.15, p = 0.0717, ES \u22120.20) study. The percentage of improved participants on the dichotomized CGI-I at end of treatment was significantly greater with LDX than with OROS-MPH in the forced-dose study (81.4 vs. 71.3%, p = 0.0188) but not the flexible-dose study (LDX 83.1%, OROS-MPH 81.0%, p = 0.6165). The LS mean \u00b1 SEM treatment differences for change from baseline on the ADHD-RS-IV hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattentiveness subscales nominally favored LDX in the forced-dose study (hyperactivity/impulsivity subscale \u22121.3 \u00b1 0.49, nominal p = 0.0081, ES \u22120.27; inattentiveness subscale \u22122.0 \u00b1 0.63, nominal p = 0.0013, ES \u22120.33), but there were no significant differences between active treatments in the flexible-dose study. In both studies, LDX and OROS-MPH were superior to placebo for all efficacy-related endpoints (all nominal p &lt; 0.0001; ES range \u22120.43 to \u22121.16). The overall frequency of TEAEs for LDX and OROS-MPH, respectively, were 66.5 and 58.9% in the forced-dose study and 83.2 and 82.1% in the flexible-dose study. TEAEs occurring in \u2265 5% of participants that were also reported at two or more times the rate of placebo were decreased appetite, decreased weight, insomnia, initial insomnia, dry mouth, and nasopharyngitis (LDX and OROS-MPH), irritability and dizziness (LDX only), and increased heart rate (OROS-MPH only) in the forced-dose study and decreased appetite, decreased weight, insomnia, and dizziness (LDX and OROS-MPH) and dry mouth and upper abdominal pain (LDX only) in the flexible-dose study. Mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) increases from baseline in vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse) were observed in the forced-dose study [LDX 1.6 \u00b1 9.65 and 3.3 \u00b1 8.11 mmHg, 6.7 \u00b1 12.78 beats per minute (bpm); OROS-MPH 2.6 \u00b1 10.15 and 3.3 \u00b1 9.13 mmHg, 7.6 \u00b1 12.47 bpm] and the flexible-dose study (LDX 2.4 \u00b1 9.46 and 2.8 \u00b1 8.41 mmHg, 4.7 \u00b1 11.82 bpm; OROS-MPH 0.4 \u00b1 9.90 and 2.2 \u00b1 8.64 mmHg, 6.0 \u00b1 10.52 bpm) at the last on-treatment assessment.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.\nLDX was superior to OROS-MPH in adolescents with ADHD in the forced-dose but not the flexible-dose study. Safety and tolerability for both medications was consistent with previous studies. These findings underscore the robust acute efficacy of both psychostimulant classes in treating adolescents with ADHD.\n\nABSTRACT.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV REGISTRY NUMBERS.\nNCT01552915 and NCT01552902.\n\nABSTRACT.ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s40263-017-0468-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",
        "target": "\n\nSo, there are two different medications for ADHD called lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) and osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH). Researchers wanted to see which one works better, so they did two studies with a total of 300 kids. They gave half of the kids LDX and the other half OROS-MPH. They looked at how well the medications worked after 8 or 6 weeks of taking them. They found that LDX worked better than OROS-MPH in one of the studies, but not the other. Both medications were better than a placebo (a dummy pill with no medicine). The researchers also looked at the side effects of the medications and found that they were generally similar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tommy asked me to explain this passage To Him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
