        "target": "This study talks about how different types of tools used by dentists can sometimes cause fine lines, called cracks, in the roots of teeth. There were three different types of tools tested: Reciproc, ProTaper Universal, and Mtwo. \n\nScientists conducted this experiment on a hundred old teeth that had been pulled out. The teeth were divided into four equal groups. The first three groups of teeth were each treated with one of the three tools, while the fourth group of teeth was left as it was. \n\nAfter the experiment, the scientists cut each tooth into sections and looked at them under a microscope. They were checking how many cracks were created by each tool. \n\nThey found that all tools made some cracks, but the Reciproc tool made the least. The other two tools made significantly more cracks. \n\nSo, in simple words, this research found out that of the three tools tested, the Reciproc tool is less likely to cause fine lines or cracks in the roots of the teeth than the other two.",

We examined engagement generated by content based on the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM) in a motivationally tailored smoking cessation intervention on Facebook.\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.\nThis study aimed to identify which intervention content based on the TTM (Decisional Balance and 10 processes of change) generated the highest engagement among participants in pre-action stages of change (Precontemplation, Contemplation, and Preparation).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS.\nParticipants (N=79, 20% female, mean age 20.8) were assessed for readiness to quit smoking and assigned to one of 7 secret Facebook groups tailored to their stage of change. Daily postings to the groups based on TTM Decisional Balance and the 10 processes of change were made by research staff over 3 months. Engagement was operationalized as the number of participant comments to each post. TTM content-based predictors of number of comments were analyzed and stratified by baseline stage of change, using negative binomial regression analyses with and without zero inflation.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nA total of 512 TTM-based posts generated 630 individual comments. In Precontemplation and Contemplation groups, Decisional Balance posts generated above average engagement (P=.01 and P&lt;.001). In Contemplation groups, posts based on the TTM processes Dramatic Relief and Self-Liberation resulted in below average engagement (P=.01 and P=.005). In Preparation groups, posts based on Consciousness Raising generated above average engagement (P=.009). Participant engagement decreased over time and differed between groups within Precontemplation and Contemplation stages, but was independent of day of the week and time of day the content was posted to the groups. No participant baseline characteristics significantly predicted engagement.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.\nParticipants not ready to quit in the next 30 days (in Precontemplation or Contemplation) engaged most when prompted to think about the pros and cons of behavior change, while those in the Preparation stage engaged most when posts increased awareness about smoking and smoking cessation. Findings support tailoring intervention content to readiness to quit and suggest intervention components that may be most effective in generating high participant engagement on social media.",
        "target": "\nSocial media can be a great way to help people stop smoking, but past efforts have not been very successful. We wanted to see which types of messages on Facebook would get the most attention from people who are thinking about quitting smoking. We found that people in the early stages of quitting (Precontemplation and Contemplation) were most interested in messages that talked about the pros and cons of quitting, while people who were closer to quitting (Preparation) were most interested in messages that informed them about smoking and how to quit. This study shows that it's important to tailor messages to the person's stage of change when trying to help them quit smoking on social media.",

The main goal was to see which group would live longer.\n\nIn total, they had 17 patients, from whom 13 responded well enough to the first drugs to continue with the rest of the treatment. After following these patients for over five years, they saw that none of the two treatment methods made people live significantly longer than the other.\n\nAlso, they noticed that patients who had more miR-21 molecule in their blood at the beginning did not do as well, meaning they had lesser disease-free time and overall survival time compared to patients with lower miR-21.\n\nIn simple terms, additional cetuximab drug didn't help people live longer. But knowing how much miR-21 is there in their blood can give an idea about how the patient might fare.",

This study evaluated safety and efficacy of a combination approach of chemotherapy followed by chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) +/\u2212 cetuximab, and the prognostic role of miR-21 in patients with LAPC treated with a multimodality approach.\n\nABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS:\nThis was a randomised phase II trial in which patients with inoperable LAPC were offered gemcitabine and capecitabine (GEM-CAP) for 16 weeks. Patients with stable disease or response after GEM-CAP were randomised to capecitabine or UFT plus radiotherapy (RT) (A), or capecitabine or UFT plus cetuximab plus RT (B). The primary outcome of the study was overall survival (OS). Clinical outcome was compared according to baseline circulating miR-21 levels.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:\n17 patients were enrolled and treated with GEM-CAP, with 13 patients achieving disease control and being randomised to arms A (n:7) and B (n:6). After a median follow-up of 61.2 months, median progression free survival (PFS) was 10.4 months and 12.7 months, median OS was 15.8 months and 22.0 months in arms A and B respectively (p &gt; 0.05). Patients with high baseline plasma miR-21 had worse PFS (3.5 vs. 12.7 months; p:0.032) and OS (5.1 vs 15.3 months; p:0.5) compared to patients with low miR-21. Circulating miR-21 levels reflected miR-21 expression within the tissues.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:\nAddition of Cetuximab to CRT following induction chemotherapy did not improve survival. High miR-21 baseline plasma expression was associated with poor clinical outcome in LAPC patients treated with induction chemotherapy followed by chemo-radiotherapy.",

        "target": "This study is about training people to use a certain kind of artificial limb called a body-powered prosthesis. The researchers wanted to see if learning to do basic tasks with the artificial limb translated to being able to do more complex or \"functional\" tasks. So, they got groups of people to train using a simulator of the prosthesis for two weeks, doing different tasks like grasping. They had to handle objects of different softness and the researchers measured their ability to control the grip and the movement of the artificial limb. \n\nThey found out that everyone, even those who didn't train, got better at using the prosthesis over time. How the participants trained did affect how much they improved, but not by a lot. Movements became quicker and participants were better at closing the prosthesis. The group that practiced grasping things indirectly saw more benefits than the others. The strength of the grip didn\u2019t improve much.\n\nSo, the study concluded that learning to work with a body-powered prosthesis did carry over to doing more complex tasks, even after a period of not using it. They therefore recommend that training of a body-powered prosthesis should start with practicing indirect grasping tasks and practicing the orientation of the prosthetic hook to the object being manipulated.",

The researchers think it's important to start training with indirect grasping tasks and to practice hook-object orientations.\n\nSo, in simple terms, the study found that people who use body-powered prosthetic limbs can improve their hand function by practicing certain tasks, and that these improvements last even after a period of time without practicing. The researchers suggest that it's best to start training with tasks that involve indirect grasping, like picking up small objects, and to also practice tasks that involve hook-object orientations, like closing a hook on an object.",

They tested two groups of adults, one younger and one older, using a special brain test. They made them do listening and seeing tasks at the same time, with some tasks being harder than others. What they found was that the harder the task, the harder the people had to listen, no matter how old they were. This special brain test could help us understand why it might be hard for people to listen, especially when there is a lot of noise around.",

One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction post hoc test revealed the combination of groups with significant differences in the mean VAS scores at the different interval of time (P &lt; 0.01).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS::\nConvincingly, the combined application of 5% KNO3 with the diode laser can be recommended for treating DH patients.",
        "target": "\n\"Scientists wanted to find a way to treat a condition called dentinal hypersensitivity. They tried using different concentrations of a medicine called potassium nitrate and different levels of a special kind of laser energy. They found that using a combination of the medicine and the laser worked the best and gave the most relief from the pain. They think this combination could be a good way to treat people with dentinal hypersensitivity.\"\nIs this a good job of rephrasing? Are there any suggestions you have for improving it?",

The most effective diabetes prevention method in prediabetic adults is lifestyle modification. However, despite the benefits of lifestyle change, diabetes prevalence continues to increase. Maintaining a regular exercise routine and a healthy eating plan may be difficult because of the negative emotional barriers (i.e., stress, mood) that a prediabetic individual faces. This is particularly evident in older individuals when you combine that with decreases in mobility and geriatric syndromes. A potential treatment for these emotional barriers is a natural supplement called 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). In the current study, the group included 154 participants, both men and women, ranging between the ages of 41 to 71 years old. The study design was a double-blind, randomized parallel-group study. The Psychosocial Depressive Symptoms Questionnaire (PDS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were used to examine the effect of two doses of 5-ALA (15 mg and 50 mg) on various components of mood (i.e., hopefulness, loneliness, and motivation) and coping ability. Using SAS software, an ordered logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between the dose groups (control, 15 mg, and 50 mg) and the responses to the two questionnaires, the PDS and PSS, used in this study. An integrative literature review, using the PubMed database, searched for studies on the relationship between 5-ALA administration and mood and coping ability. Our literature review resulted in zero published articles. Next, we found that the intake of 5-ALA was significantly associated with improved coping ability (p = 0.004) and improved self-perception of effort spent (p = 0.002). Finally, we found a significant dose-dependent relationship for the association of 5-ALA intake on measures of effort (p = 0.003), loneliness (p = 0.006), and coping ability (p = 0.003). The 50 mg dose was more effective than the 15 mg dose in improving these measures. In conclusion, after 12 weeks of taking 5-ALA, we found significant improvements in self-perception of effort spent, loneliness, and coping ability in prediabetic middle age and older adults. Improved mood and coping ability may allow prediabetic individuals to overcome the emotional obstacles preventing them from maintaining a healthy lifestyle and ultimately, help them to avoid the development of diabetes.",

The severity of symptoms including halitosis and foreign body sensation was reported 7 days, 1 month, and 6 months after the procedure. Patient pain levels and amount of bleeding were evaluated as safety outcome measures. Pain levels were evaluated during the intervention, and at Day 1, 3, and 7 following the procedure using a visual analog scale (VAS).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS::\nMean rank of pain score in the RF tonsil ablation group was found to be higher than in the CO2-LC group at all measured timepoints following the procedure. The amount of bleeding in the LC group was found to be significantly less than in the RF group (P&lt;0.05). No significant difference was found between the groups regarding duration of procedure (P=0.157).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION::\nBoth procedures were found to be effective and safe in the treatment of CT-associated halitosis. However, LC showed better results based on lower pain levels, lower incidence of bleeding, and faster progression to a routine diet.",
        "target": "This passage is about a science experiment where doctors wanted to compare two different treatments for a condition called chronic caseous tonsillitis, which can cause bad breath and the feeling of a foreign object in the throat. They divided 62 patients into two groups - half got a treatment called RF tonsil ablation and the other half got a treatment called CO2 laser cryptolysis. The doctors then monitored them to see which group felt better and had fewer side effects.\n\nWhat they found was that both treatments worked well, but the patients who got the CO2 laser treatment had lower pain levels, less bleeding, and were able to get back to regular eating faster than the ones who got the RF tonsil ablation. So, the CO2 laser treatment seems to be the better option.",

        "target": "\nThe study compared two ways to treat bad breath caused by a tonsil infection. One way used a special machine to heat up the tonsils and kill the bad bacteria. The other way used a laser to make small cuts in the tonsils and let them heal on their own. Both ways worked well, but the las can cause less pain and bleeding.\n\n\n",
