Serum-procalcitonin (PCT) can be used to guide treatment when bacterial infection is suspected. Its role in pediatric LRTI is unclear.

ABSTRACT.METHODS: Between 01/2009 and 02/2010 we randomized previously healthy patients 1 month to 18 years old presenting with LRTI to the emergency departments of two pediatric hospitals in Switzerland to receive antibiotics either according to a PCT guidance algorithm established for adult LRTI or standard care clinical guidelines. In intention-to-treat analyses, antibiotic prescribing rate, duration of antibiotic treatment, and number of days with impairment of daily activities within 14 days of randomization were compared between the two groups.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS: In total 337 children, mean age 3.8 years (range 0.1–18), were included. Antibiotic prescribing rates were not significantly different in PCT guided patients compared to controls (OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.81, 1.95). Mean duration of antibiotic exposure was reduced from 6.3 to 4.5 days under PCT guidance (−1.8 days; 95% CI −3.1, −0.5; P = 0.039) for all LRTI and from 9.1 to 5.7 days for pneumonia (−3.4 days 95% CI −4.9, −1.7; P<0.001). There was no apparent difference in impairment of daily activities between PCT guided and control patients.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: PCT guidance reduced antibiotic exposure by reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment, while not affecting the antibiotic prescribing rate. The latter may be explained by the low baseline prescribing rate in Switzerland for pediatric LRTI and the choice of an inappropriately low PCT cut-off level for this population.

",True,"Simple Explanation:

Antibiotics are sometimes used too often in children and teenagers suffering from infections in their lower respiratory system (the lungs and associated parts). They can be guided by a biological marker in the blood, called procalcitonin (PCT), where high levels often suggest bacterial infection. But, it's unclear how useful this is for these types of infections in children.

In our study, from 2009 to 2010, we selected healthy youngsters between 1 month and 18 years of age, who were showing signs of lower respiratory infections. They ended up in emergency departments of two Swiss children's hospitals. There, they were randomly chosen to join one of two groups. One group was given antibiotics based on their PCT levels, following a process developed for adults. The other group was treated according to standard guidelines.

We tracked 337 children, with an average age of about 4 years. We found no significant difference between the two groups in terms of whether antibiotics were given. However, we did see that the PCT-guided group was given antibiotics for fewer days. On average, this group was on this treatment for 4.5 days instead of 6.3. The same was true for those with pneumonia, who were on antibiotics for 5.7 days instead of 9.1. We didn't notice any difference in how the children's day-to-day activities were affected.

In conclusion, basing antibiotic use on PCT levels didn't seem to influence whether antibiotics were given, but it did shorten how long these medicines were used. The reason for the first finding might be that Switzerland generally uses fewer antibiotics for these types of infections in children. Or, the PCT level we used to decide on treatment could have been set too low for this age group.

However, a lack of clarity exists as to whether the tests are in fact able to detect changes in cognition.

ABSTRACT.AIM: To examine if the continuous reaction time test (CRT) can detect changes in cognition with anti-HE intervention in patients with cirrhosis and without clinically manifest hepatic encephalopathy (HE).

ABSTRACT.METHODS: Firstly, we conducted a reproducibility analysis and secondly measured change in CRT induced by anti-HE treatment in a randomized controlled pilot study: We stratified 44 patients with liver cirrhosis and without clinically manifest HE according to a normal (n = 22) or abnormal (n = 22) CRT. Each stratum was then block randomized to receive multimodal anti-HE intervention (lactulose+branched-chain amino acids+rifaximin) or triple placebos for 3 months in a double-blinded fashion. The CRT is a simple PC-based test and the test result, the CRT index (normal threshold > 1.9), describes the patient's stability of alertness during the 10–minute test. Our study outcome was the change in CRT index in each group at study exit. The portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE) test, a paper-and-pencil test battery (normal threshold above -5), was used as a comparator test according to international guidelines.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS: The patients with an abnormal CRT index who were randomized to receive the active intervention normalized or improved their CRT index (mean change 0.92 ± 0.29, p = 0.01). Additionally, their PSE improved (change 3.85 ± 1.83, p = 0.03). There was no such effect in any of the other study groups.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with liver cirrhosis and no manifest HE, the CRT identified a group in whom cognition improved with intensive anti-HE intervention. This finding infers that the CRT can detect a response to treatment and might help in selecting patients for treatment.",True,"Simplified version:

This study was about a condition called Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy (MHE), which is a subtle problem in the brain caused by liver disease but doesn't show any symptoms and can only be diagnosed by performing certain brain performance tests. There's a bit of confusion about whether these tests really do find small changes in brain function. 

We were testing to see if a particular exam, known as the continuous reaction time test (CRT), could pick up changes in brain performance in patients who have a kind of liver disease called cirrhosis but no obvious signs of brain problems (HE for short). 

What we did was two parts: first we made sure the test gave consistent results, and then we saw if the test results changed before and after a specific treatment in a small, controlled trial. We randomly gave 44 cirrhosis patients a treatment mix of different things (lactulose, amino acids, and rifaximin) or a placebo (a harmless substance with no treatment effect) for 3 months. The CRT involves patients' response time to computer prompts and measures their alertness. We compared any change in patient's scores on CRT and another traditional test for HE called PSE. 

Our findings showed that the group with abnormal CRT scores who got the actual treatment saw their scores improve or go back to normal, and their PSE scores improved as well. This didn't happen in any of the other groups. 

Therefore, in patients with liver cirrhosis who don't show clear symptoms of brain trouble, the CRT can help identify who may improve with this treatment blend. This suggests that the CRT can register improvements from treatment and could be useful to decide which patients should receive the treatment."

ABSTRACT.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this 24-week trial, 973 insulin-naive type 2 diabetic patients on stable oral glucose-lowering drugs with A1C 7.0–10.5% were randomized to glargine once daily or detemir twice daily. Insulin doses were systematically titrated.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS: 27.5 and 25.6% of patients reached the primary outcome with glargine and detemir, respectively, demonstrating the noninferiority of glargine. Improvements in A1C were −1.46 ± 1.09% for glargine and −1.54 ± 1.11% for detemir (P = 0.149), with similar proportions of patients achieving A1C <7% (P = 0.254) but more detemir-treated patients reaching A1C <6.5% (P = 0.017). Hypoglycemia risk was similar. Weight gain was higher for glargine (difference: 0.77 kg, P < 0.001). Glargine doses were lower than detemir doses: 43.5 ± 29.0 vs. 76.5 ± 50.5 units/day (P < 0.001).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: In insulin-naive type 2 diabetic patients, glargine reached similar control as detemir, with more weight gain, but required significantly lower doses.",True,"Simple explanation:

The aim of this study was to compare two types of insulin treatments, glargine and detemir, to see if glargine was as effective in controlling blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes without causing serious low blood sugar symptoms.

The study lasted for 24 weeks and included 973 people with type 2 diabetes who hadn't used insulin before but were on regular diabetes medication. These patients had different levels of blood sugar control at the start. They were divided into two groups. One group took glargine once a day, the other group took detemir twice a day. The amounts of insulin each person took were carefully adjusted throughout the study.

The results of the study showed that a slightly higher percentage of individuals taking glargine achieved the target blood sugar levels, showing that glargine was as effective as detemir. The blood sugar reduction was almost the same in both groups, and a similar number of patients achieved good blood sugar control. However, more patients treated with detemir reached a tighter control of blood sugar. The risk of low blood sugar was the same for both treatments, but the glargine group gained slightly more weight. Importantly, those who took glargine needed lower doses compared to the ones taking detemir.

To sum up, in patients with type 2 diabetes who had never used insulin before, glargine was as effective as detemir in controlling blood sugar levels, but it caused a bit more weight gain and needed lower doses."

This study was about a drug called perindopril, which is used to treat coronary artery disease (CAD), a condition that affects the blood vessels of the heart. The goal was to see if using this drug for a long time could improve the health of blood vessels (endothelial function).

In the study, half of the patients took perindopril every day for three years, while the other half took a fake pill (placebo). The health of the patients' blood vessels was checked using ultrasound, which is a type of imaging. The main thing the study looked at was the change in blood flow created by the blood vessels (flow-mediated vasodilatation or FMD) after three years.

The study found that patients who took perindopril had a small improvement in blood vessel health. However, the improvement was very small and could also have been due to chance (not statistically significant). So, while perindopril may help to some extent, the difference it makes is minor."

There is a paucity of comparative data on the various low-dose regimens of oral isotretinoin in the Indian literature.

ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES:: To assess and compare the efficacy and tolerability of two low-dose oral isotretinoin treatment regimens (20 mg daily and 20 mg alternate days) in moderate to severe acne vulgaris.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: A total of 240 patients with moderate to severe acne vulgaris were selected and randomized into two groups and treated with a fixed dose of 20 mg of isotretinoin (Group A - daily and Group B - alternate days) for 24 weeks and followed up for 12 weeks post therapy.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:: A total of 234 patients completed the study. At the end of therapy, decrease in the total acne loads up to 98.99% (Group A) and 97.69% (Group B) was achieved from the baseline (P < 0.01), excellent response was observed in 98.3% (Group A) and 93.96% (Group B) patients (P = 0.166). In the severe acne, Group A performed significantly better than Group B until the end of 36 weeks.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: Both isotretinoin regimens were well tolerated and found to be an effective treatment for moderate to severe acne vulgaris. However, in moderate acne 20 mg alternate day regimen may be preferred. A 20 mg daily regimen is a better choice for severe acne in terms of response.

ABSTRACT.LIMITATION:: Small sample size and short follow-up period.",True,"Simplified version:

The study focuses on the use of a drug called ""isotretinoin"" for treating severe forms of acne. Isotretinoin has been used effectively even in smaller doses to treat various types of acne. 

The main aim was to see how well two lower-dose oral isotretinoin treatments work when used daily or every other day to treat severe acne. 

For this study, 240 people with severe acne were divided evenly into two groups. One group received 20 mg of isotretinoin every day while the other took the same dose every other day. This was continued for about six months (24 weeks). The researchers then checked up on the patients for another three months after the treatment had ended.

A total of 234 people completed the study. The group that took the treatment daily showed a 98.99% decrease in their acne. While the group that took the alternate-days treatment showed a 97.69% decrease. But in cases of very severe acne, the daily dose worked better than the every-other-day dose up to 36 weeks of treatment. Although in cases of moderate acne, any significant difference in effect of both dosages was only seen up to 12 weeks.

None of the patients suffered any serious side effects. In conclusion, both treatment methods are safe and effective for severe acne, but for moderate acne, taking the drug every other day may be better. The treatment works best for severe acne when used daily. 

One limitation of the study was that it only had a small number of patients and the researchers only followed up with them for a short time after treatment."
