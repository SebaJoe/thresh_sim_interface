Eighteen subjects (11 male and 7 female, aged 7.8\u201318.2 years) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or etanercept. Inclusion criteria included age 3\u201318 years, GAD-65 and/or islet cell antibody positivity, A1C &gt;6%, three insulin injections per day, white blood cell count 3,000\u201310,000, platelets &gt;100,000, and normal liver and renal function. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:\nA1C at week 24 was lower in the etanercept group (5.91 \u00b1 0.5%) compared with that in the placebo group (6.98 \u00b1 1.2%; P &lt; 0.05) with a higher percent decrease from baseline than in the placebo group (etanercept 0.41 \u00b1 0.1 vs. placebo 0.18 \u00b1 0.21; P &lt; 0.01). The percent change in C-peptide area under the curve from baseline to week 24 showed a 39% increase in the etanercept group and a 20% decrease in the placebo group (P &lt; 0.05). From baseline to week 24 insulin dose decreased 18% in the etanercept group compared with a 23% increase in the placebo group (P &lt; 0.05). Seventeen patients completed the study, and none withdrew because of adverse events.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:\nIn this small pilot study, treatment of pediatric patients newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes with etanercept resulted in lower A1C and increased endogenous insulin production, suggesting preservation of \u03b2-cell function. A larger study is needed to further explore safety and efficacy.",

Type 1 diabetes is when your body doesn't make enough insulin, which is a hormone that helps your body use sugar for energy. The medicine was given to 18 children for 24 weeks, and the results showed that it helped lower their blood sugar levels and increase the amount of insulin their bodies made on their own.

OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph. IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous. Main outcome measures were inpatient stay (prior to birth, in Birthing Unit, total), mode of birth, induction to delivery interval, adverse reactions and patient satisfaction.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nOPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth (21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs, p &lt; .001), IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit (53% vs. 28%, p = .01). Vaginal birth rates (66% OPC Vs. 71% IP), total induction to delivery time (33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs) and total inpatient times (96 hrs OPC Vs. 105 hrs IP) were similar. OPC group felt less pain (significant discomfort 26% Vs 58%, p = .003), and had more sleep (5.8 Vs 3.4 hours, p &lt; .001), during cervical preparation, but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL (88 Vs 59%, p = .001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.\nOPC was feasible and acceptable for IOL of women with an unfavourable cervix at term compared to IP, however did not show a statistically significant reduction in total inpatient stay and was associated with increased oxytocin IOL.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN:12609000420246.",
        "target": "This report talks about a study where they were trying to find out the best way to start labor for women who were having trouble starting it naturally. They compared two methods: one where the woman stays in the hospital and they use a special medication, and another where the woman can go home with a device that helps start labor. They found out that the at-home method allowed women to have less time in the hospital before the baby's birth, and the women felt less pain and got more sleep. But, it was also more likely that they needed additional help to start labor. Basically, both ways have their pros and cons.",

In each patient one ovary was randomly allocated to retrieval with either a 20 G/ 35 mm (thin) or 17 G/ 35 mm (standard) needle, the other ovary was then retrieved with the opposite needle.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nThe standard diameter needle was used to collect a total of 215 oocytes from 355 aspirated follicles (60.6%) compared to 203 oocytes from 352 aspirated follicles (57.7%) with the thinner needle (p = 0.23). Stratifying outcomes by anti-Mu\u0308llerian hormone (AMH), as indicator of ovarian reserve, and by body mass index (BMI) the oocyte yields, still, did not differ (AMH, r (17) = \u22120.20, p = 0.44; BMI, r (17) =0.02, p = 0.96). Outcomes also did not vary among women with diminished ovarian reserve (p = 0.17) and in women with normal ovarian reserve (p = 1.00). Operating time was, however, significantly increased by 3.3 minutes per ovary (z = \u22123.08, p = 0.002) with the thinner needle.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.\nNeedle diameter does not affect oocyte yield, including in obese patients and patients with diminished ovarian reserve. Thinner needles appear to significantly prolong operating time.",

In the present study, we evaluated Se status in UK pregnant women to establish whether pre-pregnant Se status or Se supplementation affected the risk of developing PE/PIH. The samples originated from the SPRINT (Selenium in PRegnancy INTervention) study that randomised 230 UK primiparous women to treatment with Se (60 \u03bcg/d) or placebo from 12 weeks of gestation. Whole-blood Se concentration was measured at 12 and 35 weeks, toenail Se concentration at 16 weeks, plasma selenoprotein P (SEPP1) concentration at 35 weeks and plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx3) activity at 12, 20 and 35 weeks. Demographic data were collected at baseline. Participants completed a FFQ. UK pregnant women had whole-blood Se concentration lower than the mid-range of other populations, toenail Se concentration considerably lower than US women, GPx3 activity considerably lower than US and Australian pregnant women, and low baseline SEPP1 concentration (median 3\u00b700, range 0\u00b790\u20135\u00b780 mg/l). Maternal age, education and social class were positively associated with Se status. After adjustment, whole-blood Se concentration was higher in women consuming Brazil nuts (P= 0\u00b7040) and in those consuming more than two seafood portions per week (P= 0\u00b7054). A stepwise logistic regression model revealed that among the Se-related risk factors, only toenail Se (OR 0\u00b738, 95 % CI 0\u00b717, 0\u00b787, P= 0\u00b7021) significantly affected the OR for PE/PIH. On excluding non-compliers with Se treatment, Se supplementation also significantly reduced the OR for PE/PIH (OR 0\u00b730, 95 % CI 0\u00b709, 1\u00b700, P= 0\u00b7049). In conclusion, UK women have low Se status that increases their risk of developing PE/PIH. Therefore, UK women of childbearing age need to improve their Se status.",
        "target": "This study looked at the dietary intake and status of the trace mineral Se in pregnant women in the UK, to determine whether this could affect the risk of developing hypertensive conditions of pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PE/PIH). The results showed that UK pregnant women have lower Se status than the mid-range of other populations, as well as lower levels of the selenoprotein P (SEPP1) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx3) which are involved in Se metabolism. Women consuming Brazil nuts and more than two seafood portions per week had higher Se status. After adjusting for other factors, it was found that lower levels of Se in the toenails was associated with an increased risk of PE/PIH. Additionally, Se supplementation was found to reduce the risk of PE/PIH. These results suggest that UK pregnant women need to improve their Se status in order to reduce their risk of developing hypertensive conditions of pregnancy.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt;",

However, there is limited research on chronic alcohol consumption with Helicobacter pylori infection. We sought to investigate the relationship between the cytokine profile, oxidative balance and H. pylori infection in subjects with chronic alcohol consumption. A total of 142 subjects were divided into three groups: 59 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion and H. pylori infection (group A); 53 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion without H. pylori infection (group B); and 30 control subjects (group C). The serum levels of CagA, interleukin (IL)-10, E-selectin, TNF-\u03b1, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the ages and serum H. pylori CagA levels among the three groups, as well as both the mean drinking age and the mean daily alcohol consumption between groups A and B, were matched and comparable. Comparing the BMIs among the three groups, the BMI differences were found to be statistically significant (F=3.921, P&lt;0.05). Compared with group C, the BMIs in groups A and B were significantly higher (P&lt;0.001 and P&lt;0.01, respectively); however, the BMI differences between group A and group B were not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05).

FMD, HIV-specific variables, expression of HIV co-receptors, markers of inflammation and coagulation and cellular markers of immune activation were measured at weeks 0, 8 and 16. The changes (\u0394) in these variables were compared between intervention and control periods using non-parametric tests. To evaluate the relation with the change in FMD, linear regression modeling was used.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nTwenty-one male patients with suppressed plasma HIV-RNA, on cART, had a known HIV infection for 9.2 years (IQR 6.9\u201313.5) with abacavir use for 6.5 years (2.8\u20139.3).

They broke up 90 patients who were about to have surgery into three groups. The first group was given 1 milligram for each kilogram they weighed of the hydrocortisone, and the second group got 2 milligrams for each kilogram they weighed. The third group got a shot of salt water, which is what we call a placebo.\n\nThey found out that the group that got the most shivers was the one who got the salt water shot. So, the medication did help to reduce the shivering, and it worked better with the smaller dose. This study suggests that giving hydrocortisone to patients who are getting spinal anesthesia could help prevent them from getting the shivers.",

This study tested the effects of inhalation of Lavandula angustifolia Mill.

This randomised control study recruited 66 subjects with indwelling urinary catheters after undergoing CRC surgery who later underwent catheter removal. Patients inhaled 1% lavender, 1% linalyl acetate, or vehicle (control group) for 20 minutes. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), heart rate, LUTS, and visual analog scales of pain magnitude and quality of life (QoL) regarding urinary symptoms were measured before and after inhalation. Systolic BP, diastolic BP, heart rate, LUTS, and QoL satisfaction with urinary symptoms were similar in the three groups. Significant differences in pain magnitude and urinary residual sense of indwelling catheters were observed among the three groups, with inhalation of linalyl acetate being significantly more effective than inhalation of lavender or vehicle. Inhalation of linalyl acetate is an effective nursing intervention to relieve pain and urinary residual sense of indwelling urinary catheters following their removal from patients who underwent CRC surgery.",

Sixty-six patients were randomly assigned to inhale either 1% lavender oil, 1% linalyl acetate, or a placebo (vehicle). Before and after catheter removal, patients' blood pressure, heart rate, urinary symptoms, and quality of life (QoL) regarding urinary symptoms were measured. The results showed that inhaling linalyl acetate was more effective than inhaling lavender oil or the vehicle in relieving pain and urinary residual sense. Inhaling linalyl acetate was also more effective than the other two treatments in improving QoL regarding urinary symptoms.

The aim of this study was to establish a standard chemoradiotherapy treatment regimen in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer.\n\nABSTRACT.SUMMARY.METHODS.\nThe CONVERT trial was an open-label, phase 3, randomised superiority trial. We enrolled adult patients (aged \u226518 years) who had cytologically or histologically confirmed limited-stage small-cell lung cancer, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0\u20132, and adequate pulmonary function. Patients were recruited from 73 centres in eight countries. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 45 Gy radiotherapy in 30 twice-daily fractions of 1\u00b75 Gy over 19 days, or 66 Gy in 33 once-daily fractions of 2 Gy over 45 days, starting on day 22 after commencing cisplatin\u2013etoposide chemotherapy (given as four to six cycles every 3 weeks in both groups). The allocation method used was minimisation with a random element, stratified by institution, planned number of chemotherapy cycles, and performance status. Treatment group assignments were not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as time from randomisation until death from any cause, analysed by modified intention-to-treat. A 12% higher overall survival at 2 years in the once-daily group versus the twice-daily group was considered to be clinically significant to show superiority of the once-daily regimen. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00433563) and is currently in follow-up.\n\nABSTRACT.SUMMARY.FINDINGS.\nBetween April 7, 2008, and Nov 29, 2013, 547 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive twice-daily concurrent chemoradiotherapy (274 patients) or once-daily concurrent chemoradiotherapy (273 patients). Four patients (one in the twice-daily group and three in the once-daily group) did not return their case report forms and were lost to follow-up; these patients were not included in our analyses. At a median follow-up of 45 months (IQR 35\u201358), median overall survival was 30 months (95% CI 24\u201334) in the twice-daily group versus 25 months (21\u201331) in the once-daily group (hazard ratio for death in the once daily group 1\u00b718 [95% CI 0\u00b795\u20131\u00b745]; p=0\u00b714). 2-year overall survival was 56% (95% CI 50\u201362) in the twice-daily group and 51% (45\u201357) in the once-daily group (absolute difference between the treatment groups 5\u00b73% [95% CI \u22123\u00b72% to 13\u00b77%]). The most common grade 3\u20134 adverse event in patients evaluated for chemotherapy toxicity was neutropenia (197 [74%] of 266 patients in the twice-daily group vs 170 [65%] of 263 in the once-daily group). Most toxicities were similar between the groups, except there was significantly more grade 4 neutropenia with twice-daily radiotherapy (129 [49%] vs 101 [38%]; p=0\u00b705). In patients assessed for radiotherapy toxicity, was no difference in grade 3\u20134 oesophagitis between the groups (47 [19%] of 254 patients in the twice-daily group vs 47 [19%] of 246 in the once-daily group; p=0\u00b785) and grade 3\u20134 radiation pneumonitis (4 [3%] of 254 vs 4 [2%] of 246; p=0\u00b770). 11 patients died from treatment-related causes (three in the twice-daily group and eight in the once-daily group).\n\nABSTRACT.SUMMARY.INTERPRETATION.\nSurvival outcomes did not differ between twice-daily and once-daily concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer, and toxicity was similar and lower than expected with both regimens. Since the trial was designed to show superiority of once-daily radiotherapy and was not powered to show equivalence, the implication is that twice-daily radiotherapy should continue to be considered the standard of care in this setting.\n\nABSTRACT.SUMMARY.FUNDING.\nCancer Research UK (Clinical Trials Awards and Advisory Committee), French Ministry of Health, Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (Cancer Research Fund, Lung Cancer, and Radiation Oncology Groups).",

They tested two methods using drugs and radiation: one where patients were treated twice a day, and the other where patients were treated only once a day. The test went on for several years and hundreds of patients took part.\n\nThey expected the once-a-day treatment would be better but found that both treatments worked just the same. However, the once-a-day treatment made less patients very sick, which was a good thing. But since the test was designed to prove the once-a-day treatment was better, and it didn't, they concluded that the twice-a-day treatment should still be used.\n\nThe research was paid for by various cancer research groups from around the world.",

In this study, we examined the effects of liraglutide versus metformin on non-esterified free fatty acids, beta-cell insulin secretion, and adhesion molecule levels in patients with recent-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:\nIn this study, 60 patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean age 33.97\u2009\u00b1\u20095.67\u00a0years) were randomly assigned to receive once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide or oral metformin. Before the study and after the 8-week treatment period, a 75\u00a0g oral glucose tolerance test was performed. Plasma glucose, lipids and lipoprotein, plasma insulin, glycaemic and insulin responses, non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA), and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) levels were evaluated.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:\nAfter 8\u00a0weeks, 120\u00a0min of NEFA (155\u2009\u00b1\u2009125 vs 99\u2009\u00b1\u200973\u00a0\u00b5mol/L, P\u2009=\u20090.026) and the levels of sVCAM-1 (465\u2009\u00b1\u2009136 vs 382\u2009\u00b1\u2009131\u00a0ng/ml, P\u2009=\u20090.013) significantly decreased, while the early phase insulin secretion index (24.94 [7.78, 38.89] vs. 31.13 [17.67, 59.09], P\u2009=\u20090.031), fasting plasma insulin (104 [51, 123] vs 113 [54, 171]\u00a0mIU/L, P\u2009=\u20090.015), 60\u00a0min plasma insulin (326 [165, 441] vs 471 [334, 717]\u00a0mIU/L, P\u2009=\u20090.005), 120\u00a0min plasma insulin (401 [193, 560] vs 500 [367, 960]\u00a0mIU/L, P\u2009=\u20090.047), and insulin area under the curve (AUCins) (648 [321, 742] vs 738 [451, 1118]\u00a0mIU/L, P\u2009=\u20090.005) remarkably increased for patients in the liraglutide treatment group. The levels of sVCAM-1 dramatically decreased after 8\u00a0weeks of liraglutide treatment (503\u2009\u00b1\u2009182 vs 382\u2009\u00b1\u2009131\u00a0ng/ml, P\u2009=\u20090.046) compared to that of the metformin treatment group. At the same time, the differences before and after liraglutide treatment in 120\u00a0min of NEFA (\u2212\u200932 [\u2212\u200996, \u2212\u20095] vs 5 [\u2212\u200935, 38]\u00a0\u00b5mol/L, P\u2009=\u20090.033) and AUCins (738 [451, 1118] vs 594 [357, 1216]\u00a0mIU/L, P\u2009=\u20090.014) were remarkably enhanced compared to that of the metformin therapy. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in fasting NEFA after liraglutide or metformin treatment. The reduction of 120\u00a0min NEFA (\u0394NEFA) was positively correlated with the decrease of sVCAM-1 (\u0394sVCAM-1) after 8\u00a0weeks of liraglutide treatment (r\u2009=\u20090.523, P\u2009=\u20090.003).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:\nOur results demonstrate that liraglutide administration is more effective than metformin in reducing 120\u00a0min NEFA and suppressing sVCAM-1 levels for recent-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. We suggest that this outcome may be because liraglutide is associated with potentiating insulin secretion capacity, inhibiting vascular inflammatory cytokines, and antagonizing atherosclerosis.\n\nABSTRACT.ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL:\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12933-018-0701-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",
