Both the condition and its individual issues can lead to heart disease. There's a medicine named Telmisartan that doctors give people with high blood pressure. People think it could also help with how the body uses sugar and might improve other aspects of metabolic syndrome.\n\nThey did a trial where they picked some patients who had metabolic syndrome and divided them into two groups. For three months, one group took Telmisartan every day, while the other group took another drug named Losartan.\n\nBy the end of the trial, the group that took Telmisartan showed better results. They had lower sugar levels, the body used sugar more efficiently, and lower hemoglobin A1c, a measure of blood sugar over time. They also had lower blood pressure at all times compared to those who took Losartan. It seems that Telmisartan helped the body use sugar more efficiently partly because it works partially as a PPAR\u03b3 controller (which is like a switch inside your cells that helps manage sugar and fat). \n\nIn summary, the medicine Telmisartan was better at managing blood pressure and helped improve how the body uses sugar, unlike Losartan. This means it could be useful for people suffering from metabolic syndrome.",

Clinical benefit from CO2 inhalation in patients with craniofacial pain caused by a putative activation of TRPV1 receptor positive trigeminal neurons has also been reported. These effects are probably mediated via an activation of TRPV1 receptor - positive neurons in the nasal mucosa with subsequent central inhibitory effects (such as conditioned pain modulation). In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of intranasal CO2 on a human model of craniofacial pain elicited by nasal application of capsaicin.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:\nIn a first experiment, 48 healthy volunteers without previous craniofacial pain received intranasal capsaicin to provoke trigeminal pain elicited by activation of TRVP1 positive nociceptive neurons. Then, CO2 or air was insufflated alternatingly into the nasal cavity at a flow rate of 1 l/min for 60 sec each. In the subsequent experiment, all participants were randomized into 2 groups of 24 each and received either continuous nasal insufflation of CO2 or placebo for 18:40 min after nociceptive stimulation with intranasal capsaicin. In both experiments, pain was rated on a numerical rating scale every 60 sec.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:\nContrary to previous animal studies, the effects of CO2 on experimental trigeminal pain were only marginal. In the first experiment, CO2 reduced pain ratings only minimally by 5.3% compared to air if given alternatingly with significant results for the main factor GROUP (F1,47\u2009=\u20094.438; p\u2009=\u20090.041) and the interaction term TIME*GROUP (F2.6,121.2\u2009=\u20093.3; p\u2009=\u20090.029) in the repeated-measures ANOVA. However, these effects were abrogated after continuous insufflation of CO2 or placebo with no significant changes for the main factors or the interaction term.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:\nAlthough mild modulatory effects of low-flow intranasal CO2 could be seen in this human model of TRPV-1 mediated activation of nociceptive trigeminal neurons, utility is limited as observed changes in pain ratings are clinically non-significant.",

Clinical benefit from CO2 inhalation in patients with craniofacial pain caused by a putative activation of TRPV1 receptor positive trigeminal neurons has also been reported. These effects are probably mediated via an activation of TRPV1 receptor - positive neurons in the nasal mucosa with subsequent central inhibitory effects (such as conditioned pain modulation). In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of intranasal CO2 on a human model of craniofacial pain elicited by nasal application of capsaicin.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:\nIn a first experiment, 48 healthy volunteers without previous craniofacial pain received intranasal capsaicin to provoke trigeminal pain elicited by activation of TRVP1 positive nociceptive neurons. Then, CO2 or air was insufflated alternatingly into the nasal cavity at a flow rate of 1 l/min for 60 sec each. In the subsequent experiment, all participants were randomized into 2 groups of 24 each and received either continuous nasal insufflation of CO2 or placebo for 18:40 min after nociceptive stimulation with intranasal capsaicin. In both experiments, pain was rated on a numerical rating scale every 60 sec.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:\nContrary to previous animal studies, the effects of CO2 on experimental trigeminal pain were only marginal. In the first experiment, CO2 reduced pain ratings only minimally by 5.3% compared to air if given alternatingly with significant results for the main factor GROUP (F1,47\u2009=\u20094.438; p\u2009=\u20090.041) and the interaction term TIME*GROUP (F2.6,121.2\u2009=\u20093.3; p\u2009=\u20090.029) in the repeated-measures ANOVA. However, these effects were abrogated after continuous insufflation of CO2 or placebo with no significant changes for the main factors or the interaction term.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:\nAlthough mild modulatory effects of low-flow intranasal CO2 could be seen in this human model of TRPV-1 mediated activation of nociceptive trigeminal neurons, utility is limited as observed changes in pain ratings are clinically non-significant.",
        "target": "This study talks about a type of pain that happens in the face and head. Scientists have found in some animal experiments that letting them breathe in CO2 - the gas we breathe out - can help with this pain. They thought it might work by interacting with certain nerves in our nose. So, they wanted to see if the same thing could help humans too. \n\nThey first tested it on healthy volunteers who didn't have any head or face pain before. They used capsaicin - the stuff that makes chili peppers hot - to cause the pain, then had them breathe in either CO2 or regular air. They did this in two different ways: switching between CO2 and air every minute, or continuously breathing in CO2. The volunteers rated their pain levels every minute.\n\nUnlike the animal experiments, the CO2 didn't help the human volunteers much. It only lowered their pain ratings a little bit - only 5.3%. Even that small effect was lost when the volunteers were asked to breathe in CO2 continuously. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that while it's interesting to see that CO2 has a small effect on this type of pain in humans, it's not enough to be really helpful for treating pain.",

        "target": "Scientists wanted to know if a drug called aceclofenac, made in two different ways, could help people with knee pain from arthritis, and if it was safe. They tested it on 125 people, with some of them getting one version and some the other. They measured things like how much it hurt, how well the knee moved, and did other medical tests to check if the drug was safe. After 4 weeks, they found that both forms of the drug helped with pain and movement, and neither of them caused any harmful effects. The new form of the drug only needs to be taken once a day, which could be easier for people.",

The scientists did a test and found out that the people who took the extra melatonin remembered things better and slept better than the people who didn't take it, especially those who had trouble sleeping. This might mean that not sleeping well could also cause memory problems. The extra melatonin didn't make people feel sick and was safe to take.

The defects in each patient were randomly assigned as Group A, which were treated with the envelope type of CAF, and those in Group B were treated with envelope type of CAF along with the Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM). The recession depth (RD), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and width of the keratinized tissue (KT) were measured at baseline, at three and six month intervals.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:.\nForty-six Miller's class I and II gingival recessions were treated. In the CAF + Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM)-treated (Group B) sites the baseline gingival recession was 2.34 \u00b1 0.48 mm, while in the CAFtreated (Group A) sites it was 2.52 \u00b1 0.84 mm.

        "target": "This passage is about a scientific experiment that tested a medicine called CZP on people who have a disease called psoriatic arthritis. This disease can cause a lot of pain and problems that can make it hard for people to do their job or chores at home. \n\nIn the experiment, they divided people into three groups. The first group got a fake pill with no medicine, the second group got a small amount of CZP every 2 weeks, and the third group got a larger amount of CZP every 4 weeks. They asked these people questions about how many days they missed work or couldn't do their household chores, and how much they were able to join in family, social and leisure activities.\n\nThey found out that people who got CZP missed fewer days of work, were able to do more chores at home, and could join family activities more than those who took the fake pill. The people with CZP started to feel better and do more activities as early as the 4th week and continued to improve until the 24th week of the treatment. \n\nSo, the experiment showed that CZP medicine can help people with psoriatic arthritis do their jobs, chores, and activities better than before.",

SIRT could be repeated once in case of recurrence; while, TACE was repeated every 6 weeks until no viable tumor tissue was detected by MRI or contraindications prohibited further treatment. Patients were followed-up by MRI every 3 months; the final evaluation was 05/2013.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nBoth groups were comparable in demographics (SIRT: 8males/4females, mean age 72 \u00b1 7 years; TACE: 10males/2females, mean age 71 \u00b1 9 years), initial tumor load (1 patient \u226525 % in each group), and BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) stage (SIRT: 12\u00d7B; TACE 1\u00d7A, 11\u00d7B). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 180 days for SIRT versus 216 days for TACE patients (p = 0.6193) with a median TTP of 371 days versus 336 days, respectively (p = 0.5764). Median OS was 592 days for SIRT versus 788 days for TACE patients (p = 0.9271). Seven patients died in each group. Causes of death were liver failure (n = 4 SIRT group), tumor progression (n = 4 TACE group), cardiovascular events, and inconclusive (n = 1 in each group).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.\nNo significant differences were found in median PFS, OS, and TTP. The lower rate of tumor progression in the SIRT group was nullified by a greater incidence of liver failure. This pilot study is the first prospective randomized trial comparing SIRT and TACE for treating HCC, and results can be used for sample size calculations of future studies.",

SIRT could be repeated once in case of recurrence; while, TACE was repeated every 6 weeks until no viable tumor tissue was detected by MRI or contraindications prohibited further treatment. Patients were followed-up by MRI every 3 months; the final evaluation was 05/2013.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS.\nBoth groups were comparable in demographics (SIRT: 8males/4females, mean age 72 \u00b1 7 years; TACE: 10males/2females, mean age 71 \u00b1 9 years), initial tumor load (1 patient \u226525 % in each group), and BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) stage (SIRT: 12\u00d7B; TACE 1\u00d7A, 11\u00d7B). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 180 days for SIRT versus 216 days for TACE patients (p = 0.6193) with a median TTP of 371 days versus 336 days, respectively (p = 0.5764). Median OS was 592 days for SIRT versus 788 days for TACE patients (p = 0.9271). Seven patients died in each group. Causes of death were liver failure (n = 4 SIRT group), tumor progression (n = 4 TACE group), cardiovascular events, and inconclusive (n = 1 in each group).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.\nNo significant differences were found in median PFS, OS, and TTP. The lower rate of tumor progression in the SIRT group was nullified by a greater incidence of liver failure. This pilot study is the first prospective randomized trial comparing SIRT and TACE for treating HCC, and results can be used for sample size calculations of future studies.",
        "target": "Scientists wanted to see if two treatments, named SIRT and DEB-TACE, worked differently to treat a type of liver cancer. They divided people with this cancer into two groups, and gave one SIRT and one DEB-TACE. They watched the patients carefully for a few years to see if and how their cancer changed. What they found is that both treatments worked about the same, but people on SIRT had more problem with liver failure. This information can help them decide how many people they need for their future studies comparing these treatments.",

The study found out that the two ways are almost the same in terms of how long the cancer stays away, how long the patient lives, and how often the cancer comes back. The study also found that the patients who got SIRT had more liver problems, but the patients who got TACE had more cancer problems.
